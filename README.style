========= CODING STYLE GUIDE =========

The idea here is to have maximum similarity across the game code and have 
easy way of distinguishing between the functions across the entire codebase. 
This document is more intended towards me than the contributors, since that 
will take time.

Across the package we maintain the consistency by using the same coding style

- CamelCase for classes/structs
- underscore_name for functions, variables and everything else
