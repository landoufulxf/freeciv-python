Getting Started    The Early Game My early game strategy concentrates on getting my first city off to a good start and then a rush to expand rapidly 
That means I want to get several other cities started quickly  explore my surroundings  found my Science City and grab a few key Wonders of the World 
In this time period  I am typically aggressively expansionist and militarily ruthless  especially if I encounter neighbors like me 
The three keys to success in this time period  expand  expand  expand 
Your First City  
There you are  a settler or two  a little bit of the map visible 
Need to build that first city  but where 
The best choice for your first city is a non dimpled  no shield  grassland square 
Since you automatically get a road  irrigation and a resource in the city square  building on a grassland square maximizes your food production and does not waste a resource 
Second choice is either a plains square since it saves you from having to irrigate the square to make it useful  or a dimpled grassland square since although it wastes a resource  it does maximize your food production 
Starting on a site with wheat or buffalo can be a huge head start  and including one or more special resources like whales  fish  buffalo  wheat  silk or pheasant within the citys radius is highly advantageous as well 
Near or on a river is nearly always good spot to found a city  especially the first one 
Rivers increase the trade available  provide a ready source of water for irrigation and speed transportation along them 
Plus  cities founded on river squares avoid the need to acquire bridge building to get a road across the river 
If there is no river nearby  try to maximize the available dimpled grasslands 
Plains squares are also nice  but youll need to irrigate them before they will produce more food than it costs to work them 
Founding a city in an area entirely of plains is sometimes necessary but poses both short and long term problems 
In the short run  youll have to irrigate to get the city to grow at all  but to irrigate youll have to have a settler engineer  which the city wont have the extra food to support 
Long term food production is also a problem and it will rapidly reach a maximum supportable size which will require the late period advance of Refrigeration  to build Supermarket to exploit the farmland your engineers will have to create  to exceed 
If Im lucky enough to find a  hut  immediately nearby  I will go trigger it right away 
Be sure to save just before you move onto it 
I want either another settler  wandering nomad  or a fast unit  horseman  chariot or elephant  
Ill do a game reload with any other result  exception  if given  Monarchy  as an advance Ill keep that  
By triggering the hut before building the first city  the unit has  none  for a home and will never have any support cost 
If its a settler  Ill usually keep it and immediately put it to use making improvements  especially roads 
If I got a fast military unit  then it goes exploring looking for rival civs and more huts 
In any case  dont take more than a few turns finding a spot 
Every turn you spend wandering in search of a location  your rivals are collecting taxes  building things  and looking for you 
What to Research 
Shortly after founding your first city  youll offered some choices for a technological advance to research 
Which path to take in research is a difficult question 
Compared to Civ 1  the Civ2 technology tree is much larger and better thought out to make almost all of the advances useful and necessary 
Personally  I want to get Bronze Working right away for phalanxes  and Horseback Riding for horsemen 
Next priority is to get Monarchy which needs Code of Laws and Ceremonial Burial 
I also want to get Trade as quickly as possible to produce caravans  so that means the Currency Code of Laws Writing group 
If you are going after the Great Library  see Wonders below  then you need Literacy 
I also want the Wheel soon  both for chariots and because it leads to Invention 
In fact  my most important medium term research goal is Invention 
Needed for Gunpowder and Railroads  even more importantly  it allows building Leonardos Workshop Wonder  below  
Although Railroads are no longer the overwhelming advantage they were in Civ 1  they are still very important 
As in Civ 1  they cut your defense costs enormously because you need fewer units since you can shuttle a small  powerful army anywhere along your rail net in one turn 
Second  any square with a railroad gets a 50% bonus  rounded down  to resource production 
Unlike Civ 1  theres no impact on food or trade  so early on this will only benefit special squares  pheasant  buffalo  and mines  and forests but even limited this way  Railroad is important 
Gunpowder is now also a major goal 
The radical changes in Civ 2s combat system have made this the major advance that it should be 
Musketeers are now powerful units that will consistently and routinely defeat their pre gunpowder opponents 
Fortified in a city with walls or in a fortress  they are almost invulnerable to pre gunpowder units 
On offense  an early industrial era force of musketeers and ironclads can wreak havoc on a medieval or ancient society 
Expansion in Ancient Period  
Early in the game  cities should stay small to get the maximum benefit from a small population  to keep costs down and generate settlers for expansion 
Aggressive expansion with new cities is vital to firmly  claim  as much land as possible 
Lining a coast with cities so their production radii just touch or overlap a bit will prevent later encroachment by  friendly  rivals 
Likewise  in a large land mass  creating a ring of interlocking cities will isolate the area from other civs and let you then develop it without having to worry about another civ moving in 
A key part of this process is finding natural choke points in the land mass where you can lock out the other civs with a city or two 
In most areas you shouldnt rely on units for this function for very long  the computer civs will move a settler right up to your unit  found a city and then demand you move your units out of their territory  or break the treaty  
Sneaky and nasty  but effective  and a technique you can use  too 
Do whatever you have to do to stake out a large territory now  because it will never get easier 
But when founding these new cities keep in mind that eventually your expansion will stop 
Sooner or later you will run into another civilization  or fill up your starting continent 
With that in mind  you should found cities to minimize overlap when they reach their maximum growth 
Once your first city is built  the first thing to do is to build a warrior  phalanx or archer if you have the option  to first explore the immediate countryside and then defend the city 
Warriors are the cheapest and quickest units you can build and what we need is a quick unit to get some exploring done right away 
You need to know where to build your next city  locate any nearby rivals and trigger any close by  goodie huts  for military units  advances  or added cities 
Next priority is to defend that first city 
Either build another unit  or if you got a military unit from a hut  bring the Warrior home and let the new unit explore 
Now build a settler which makes a road or two to boost your trade and then it founds a new city 
Each time you build a new city  you should immediately assign or build a unit to defend it 
Even  friendly  civilizations will take an undefended city  and even warlike civilizations will talk before attacking a defended city 
New cities near the edges of your empire are the most vulnerable to barbarian attack  so dont leave any frontier city undefended for long 
As soon as the first settler is built in each city  add a Chariot or Elephant  Horseman if you dont have either of those available  as a second military unit 
That will strengthen the defense somewhat  but more importantly  will give you an ability to chase and capture barbarian leaders for the ransom money and destroy offensive units like chariots or catapults before they can attack your city 
Once you have a second city  one of them should produce a settler and then begin building Wonders 
At lower difficulty levels this can be delayed a bit  but at King or higher  failure to start now can result in missing a key early wonder  see section on Wonders below  
The city for early Wonder projects should have a good supply of irrigated plains or grassland squares with resources and one or two squares should be forested or hills 
If were going to build Wonders here  then resource production would seem to be what youd want to maximize and that is indeed important 
However  since my first long range goal is to set the stage for Science City  below   Ill be looking to maximize the trade available even at the cost of resources  so  river squares and roads are vital 
Sending in Caravans can compensate for a less than ideal resource situation  but lots of trade arrows are this citys real key to long term success 
And dont forget that the city that is building Wonders will need another military unit or two to keep order and ensure its defense 
Build them elsewhere and then  home  them there once youve moved them into the Science City 
Initially  you dont need to spend resources to improve any of your cities 
While a granary or a temple may seem like a good idea  they cost money for upkeep and they're not needed right away 
Money not spent on upkeep can be used many other ways  so be sure you can afford to pay for the upkeep on the improvements before you build them 
Barracks may seem like a good idea and for some players  they are 
However  they absorb shields I prefer to use in Caravans and they become obsolete and have to be rebuilt 
If you feel like you need Barracks  Id recommend getting the Sun Tzus War Academy Wonder instead 
During the early and middle parts of the game  every new city should follow the same pattern 
Build or assign a unit to guard it 
Produce a settler who accomplishes a few improvements and then founds another city 
In the meantime  the city produces a second unit  preferably a mounted unit for speed  and then shifts to turning out Caravans for trade routes and Wonders 
When its settler founds a new city  it should replace it and then return to building Caravans 
However  once the city has grown to size 4 7  depends on number of cities and level of difficulty   a Temple becomes a necessity to keep the populace content 
Your First Government  
At the start of the game your government is Despotism 
Normally that will be the only government type you have available  and it will have to do at first 
But its major limitation is food production because grasslands do not benefit from irrigation under Despotism 
The impact of this one fact is far reaching 
Every citizen in a city requires two food and any extra food is stored away 
Accumulate enough in storage and your city grows by one citizen 
If your city is to continue growing  you need at least one more food than you need to feed your citizens which means that generally speaking the only  extra  food will come from the city square itself while in Despotism 
Secondarily  its high level of corruption and waste means that the size of your empire can soon become a case of diminishing returns 
So  as soon as possible you want to switch to Monarchy 
Under Monarchy you can grow and expand much faster 
However  even if they become available quickly  I would not recommend switching to the later government forms until your initial rush for expansion is complete or nearly so 
 Governments are discussed in a later section  
The Ancient Wonders of the World  
See the table at the end of this document 
Like your choices of which technological advances to pursue  theres no one  easy answer to which WoWs you should build 
My choices are driven first by what I have the prerequisite advances for  second by what I need for the Science City and third by what I want to keep out my rivals hands 
Typically that means I go for Colossus first  with either the Great Wall or the Great Library next 
If I can get it before they do  I like to get the Oracle at any level  but its almost a necessity at Emperor or Deity level 
However  I often cannot get it because I have to use the resources to grab one or more of the Medieval Wonders before I lose them to an opponent 
Roads and Irrigation in the Ancient Period  
It's likely that you will need to irrigate squares early in the game especially once you can switch to Monarchy 
But  you can only irrigate a square that has an adjacent source of water 
Initially  this means squares adjacent to an ocean  lake  inland ocean square  or river square 
However  irrigated squares also count as a source of water  so you can steadily irrigate inland 
So  if I find a large area of plains with no nearby source of water  I will generally leave most or all of it alone until later in the game when I can afford to spend the time irrigating my way into it 
Note that once established  it is not necessary to maintain the chain of irrigated squares 
If  for example  you irrigate a hill  irrigate an adjacent plains square  and then change the hill into a mine  you will not lose the irrigation in the plains square 
Irrigation adds one to the food in a square 
This means that a plains square will now produce two food which makes them useful 
However  under Despotism  irrigation has no effect on food production in grassland squares which is the most important reason you want to switch to Monarchy as soon as possible 
While the movement benefit of roads is important  the economic benefit  trade  is even more so 
Roads add one trade to a grassland or plains square 
Initially  roads and rivers will be the primary source of trade for most cities 
The basic square under Despotism produces two food  one resource  and two trade 
To achieve this  a dimpled grassland needs only a road  and a plains square needs irrigation and a road 
In addition to the monetary  tax  benefit  increasing your trade will also increase your science research production  so be sure to add roads to every square that can benefit from it 
Early Warfare  
The changes in Civ 2 have made most of the early military units useful now 
To defend your cities you want pikemen  but the phalanxes will do until you get the necessary advance 
For offensive operations youll want elephants  but chariots will have to do if you dont have the needed advance 
Archers are a compromise unit  reasonably good both offensively and defensively  and often available early 
However  I tend to avoid them because they are more expensive than phalanxes for defense and too slow for an effective offense 
Horsemen arent adequate as combat units  but they are inexpensive and make good scouts 
When available  legions have good firepower  but like archers  their slowness limits their usefulness in most offensive operations 
As in Civ 1  many early units have a very low defense strength  one   so often the side that attacks first will win 
Chariots  elephants and horsemen move two spaces each turn  so they can advance and attack 
Other units must move adjacent to the enemy first  which means the enemy can attack first and likely win 
Despite this  the defender often has the advantage 
Hills double defense strength  and mountains triple it 
A fortified phalanx on a hill has a defense strength which is enough to defeat a chariots attack most of the time 
Even in grassland  a group of fortified phalanxes is strong enough to at least slow an attacking force down dramatically 
With their increased defensive abilities against mounted attack  pikemen are particularly good as defensive units 
With their higher attack factor and not being  mounted units   catapults are the best method for attacking positions like this  though their slowness makes them vulnerable to a preemptive attack by the mounted troops unless stacked with a pikemen 
Early offensive operations can be effectively conducted by capitalizing on this defensive advantage 
Taking control of an area can be done by moving units into unoccupied squares  fortifying the position and letting your opponent attack 
He will often lose or at least weaken several units this way  to the point that your counterattack will then succeed easily 
It's important to note that units stacked together outside a city or fortress only defend as well as the single  best defensive unit in the stack 
If that unit loses  the entire stack will be destroyed 
Sometimes its worthwhile to stack a defensive unit such as a pikeman with an offensive unit such as a catapult or a chariot  but its usually a bad idea to stack more units than that    but watch for cases when your opponents make that mistake and be sure to capitalize on it 
Advantages of Small and Large Cities  
As you play Civ 2  youll find that both small and large cities have their advantages 
However  in the early centuries  small cities have several powerful advantages 
The most important of these is the free use of the city square 
A size ten city can work eleven squares  including the city square 
Ten size one cities can work twenty squares  one for each citizen and one for each city square 
Small cities grow faster under Despotism and Monarchy 
The amount of food needed to generate a new citizen depends on the size of the city and whether a granary is present 
Even more importantly  large cities require expensive improvements to keep the populace content 
Once a city grows past a certain size  every new citizen is unhappy instead of content  depends on difficulty level  and total number of cities youve built  
The bottom line is that in the early game the advantage is on lots of small cities 
With the Science City and Production City  below  as major exceptions  I manage most of my early cities to keep them in the 3 6 range by generating settlers from them so I can expand rapidly 
However  larger cities do have definite advantages as well 
While smaller cities can work the land with fewer citizens  larger cities can get more from that work 
City improvements can multiply the effective trade and resource production of the land 
These improvements are impractical for small cities  since they cost more to maintain than they produce unless the city is large 
Larger cities can also absorb more unhappy citizens without going into civil disorder 
This can be crucial to waging war in a Democracy or a Republic 
Diplomacy  
Early in the game its almost always worthwhile to talk to an emissary from another civilization 
But be cautious about establishing  permanent  treaties with the other civs if you dont really intend to keep the peace with them 
The personality of the other civ has a lot to do with who you ought to consider making treaties with  but unless you want to be at war with everyone and have no one willing to make peace  be careful about breaking treaties or violating a cease fire 
Early on  almost all civilizations are willing to make peace  even if they make threats first 
On the other hand  demands for tribute will get less results if you've already accepted a peace treaty 
If you really wish to demand tribute and dont mind being at war  refuse the offer of peace 
If the other civilization is truly afraid of you  they will offer money  civilization advances  or both in exchange for peace 
Also be careful about trading technologies 
Im very reluctant to give most neighbors much of anything  unless I suspect he has several things I want and Im already planning to conquer him soon 
In that case  I know Ill get an advance for every city of his I take  but if he only has one city and three advances  then I need to trade for two of them first 
If I find one of the non aggressive  perfectionists civs as a neighbor  then Im likely to trade with him because hell primarily want the non military advances that Im more willing to give up 
The Middle Game  
The time period of the game I characterize as the  middle game  is roughly the medieval period up through the early industrial advances 
Its decision time 
While you can change your mind later  some basic choices have to be made about long term strategy which will largely determine your tactics for this time period 
The most fundamental choice is whether to pursue a path of conquest  or one that ends in a late game space race 
Secondarily  you need to choose between an expansionist or isolationist strategy 
Although Ill comment on a few of the differences  Im going to concentrate on maximizing your score and that means a long game  expanding for maximum population  and ending the game with the successful founding of your Alpha Centauri colony 
Based on this  my middle game objectives are to find all my rivals and to begin to control them  continue my expansion  develop my Production City and achieve a significant technological lead on the computer players 
If I can find a suitable civ  I will cultivate one of the computer players as a trading partner and ally  ideally  a smaller civ with a civilized rational leader 
The others need to be watched carefully and the aggressive ones may have to become part of my expanding empire  whether they like it or not 
For most of this time period Ill remain in Monarchy  however  I normally switch to Communism or Republic sometime in this period to prepare for the difficult move to Democracy 
The Question of Government  
By this time you should have a choice of at least a few governments and choosing between them is an interesting question 
Each has advantages and disadvantages  and Im not sure there is any such thing as the  best  
Theres a table comparing the various governments at the end of this paper 
I find I spend the majority of this period in Monarchy  although Ive successfully used Communism  especially if my empire has gotten geographically large since it dramatically reduces the loss of trade arrows due to corruption 
Others report liking Fundamentalism  especially if you intend a game of conquest 
But since my overall goal is usually to win via the Space Race  the penalty to science is too steep for me to stay in this government very long 
Ive used Republic  too  and it is even more productive than either Monarchy or Communism  but the Senates interference can be a problem  its more difficult to keep everyone happy and the loss of the no support cost units makes fielding a good sized military force difficult since my cities are numerous  but still fairly small 
These latter problems are compounded in Democracy and unless I can get several WoWs very early  I find Democracy impractical at this point 
Cities Big and Small  
Early in the game I actively discouraged cities from growing large by producing lots of settlers 
In this period that is likely to change because I may run out of room to expand and at least some of the cities now need to grow larger for their greater production potential 
Frequently I end up with a core of older cities which I encourage to grow while the others continue to spawn settlers engineers to fill up whatever territory still remains unclaimed 
Encouraging your cities to grow primarily means irrigation  especially for grassland squares 
Some forest squares can be irrigated  but since they become plains squares  they cannot be as productive as grasslands  so the grasslands come first 
Swamps and jungle should also be selectively irrigated to convert them to more productive use 
However large areas of swamp or jungle will take a lot of time to make productive  so they are best left alone until you have no other territory to develop and have engineers who can do the job quicker 
Earlier almost all my caravans went to building WoWs  now I will use some of them to establish lucrative trade routes between large cities  preferably on other continents  or even better with other civilizations 
Civic improvements are now becoming necessary 
Temples will be needed to keep the populace happy and marketplaces are appropriate for most cities to increase your trade  and therefore the science output  
Libraries are appropriate in cities already generating 8 10  beakers  
You should already have a library in your Science City  add a University as soon as allowed 
With those and a typical city of size 8 12  you should be seeing advances every 5 9 turns  perhaps even quicker 
If you bypassed the Pyramids earlier  then granaries will dramatically speed your cities growth  perhaps so much so that unhappiness becomes a problem 
In fact  unhappiness now starts becoming a major issue especially if you are playing at Emperor or Deity level 
Unhappiness is triggered not only by growth within a city  but once youve built a large number of cities  the number is dependent on difficulty level   then every new citizen added starts as unhappy 
Michelanglos Chapel is  therefore  a critically important WoW as is Bachs Cathedral 
At Emperor or Deity youll need to add more improvements  coliseum  bank  etc   to keep most everyone happy 
Cathedrals will be a necessity if you werent able to grab Michelanglos Chapel 
On the economic side of things  all these civic improvements will bust your tax budget if you are not careful 
Be careful to keep your upkeep expenses within the income your taxes are generating  here again  those trade routes and marketplaces are important because of the tax income they can generate 
I consider Adam Smiths Trading Co  a critical WoW in this period because it removes the upkeep costs for all those temples  marketplaces  and granaries 
With the Trading Co  in place I can keep my taxes low  science rate high and still be generating a reasonable income every turn 
Expansion in the Middle Game  
Although your rate of expansion may have slowed by now  you still need to be adding new cities at a steady pace 
Look for holes in the territory that you claimed early in the game and fill them in 
Your exploration may turn up small land masses suitable for one or two cities  grab them now as jump off points and forward observation posts 
You may also want them as way points for the aircraft that youll be developing and deploying later 
Of course  you can also use conquest to expand 
This can be very attractive now since absorbing a rivals area and cities will give a huge and almost instant boost 
However  diverting the resources to first producing military units and then conducting a protracted war can make this a tough choice 
For me  it comes down to exploiting opportunities as they present themselves 
I will provoke a war over an area of land I particularly want  or as a way to keep a rival from becoming dangerously large  but I want to avoid large  protracted wars if I can 
Instead  I look for opportunities to nibble away at the other civs  a quick acquisition by force or a cheap  buy out  by diplomat 
This is needed not just to sustain your own growth  but also to put the brakes on rivals who are uncomfortably powerful 
Middle Game Diplomacy  
To further my goals for the period  I will use diplomacy to establish and keep good relations with one or two friendly rival civs 
If your keep your reputation good  you should be able to keep the peace with them for a very long time 
Eventually  even the best of them will be jealous enough to start a war  but for now you can probably keep at least one of them friendly 
By now  you may well have enough cash to exploit another way to use your diplomats  inciting revolts in selected cities of your rivals 
Doing so furthers two goals at once  expands your empire and curbs theirs 
It gets you an intact city boosting your trade science production while decreasing theirs by the same amount 
Ive used it to thwart a rival who had the audacity to found a city on  my  continent or  my area  of a shared continent 
Ive also used it to grab isolated cities of an opponent  that nice little island well away from the rest of his empire  perhaps 
By inciting smaller cities and or ones that are some distance from his capital  the price is much reduced  often to the point where its cheaper to buy the city than to produce the units  go to war  and take it 
Another way to reduce the price is to use diplomats spies to sabotage one or more of his  happiness  improvements Cathedrals or Coliseums are nice targets 
Once the city becomes disrupted  the price of a revolt is decreased by 50% 
Otherwise my Diplomatic approach is simply to further my goals 
If I need to be at war with someone  then I can use diplomacy to provoke it or get a cease fire when I need a rest 
Ill try not to damage my reputation too much but breaking a treaty or a cease fire may be a strategic necessity somewhere in this time 
Medieval & Early Industrial Period Warfare  
The key issue here is simply that you need to be the first civilization to get gunpowder  metallurgy and steam power 
Unlike Civ 1  a force of musketeers and cannons on land and ironclads at sea will be more impeded by the speed at which they can move than the iron age forces that are all that should be opposing them 
Your advantage may not last long  but while it lasts  its powerful  so exploit it 
Depending on who your neighbor s  turn out to be  this is a good time to consider taking over the rest of your continent if youve not already done so 
However  I like to keep one or two computer players alive and well in this period  the non aggressive  perfectionist and or rational types 
Mainly that is so Ill have a prosperous civ to set up lucrative trade routes with  and it also allows me to concentrate on controlling or eliminating the others 
On land  only a walled city containing multiple knights or legions will resist your attack sufficiently to be a serious obstacle 
If you need such a city badly enough it will still fall  but it may well prove a costly  lengthy process 
Moving lots of musketeers up and fortifying them will give you a base on which to lay siege and enable you to move the otherwise vulnerable cannons  catapults will do if you dont have cannon yet  into range 
If you occupy most or all the resource producing squares for the city he will be forced to attack or lose some or all of the units supported by the city 
And by attacking  he loses the benefits of the walls  so your musketeers may be damaged by his attacks  but hes unlikely to be able to destroy enough of them to lift the siege 
Weakened by the attacks  he becomes even more vulnerable to your counterattack and the city falls 
Of course  the real problem is that this takes time  lots of it  so this city had better be really important 
Otherwise  isolate it and go on 
At sea  you now have a unit with enough firepower to make a port without city walls immediately vulnerable 
A couple of veteran ironclads and a couple caravels or galleons with veteran musketeers and crusaders dragoons will make quick work of most port cities 
One caveat 
Dont forget that metallurgy will make the Great Wall WoW obsolete and that means all those nice  protective city walls will go down as soon as the discovery is made 
Not a good idea to have an enemy or a horde of barbarians just outside the city when the walls go down 
This will make the mayor very peeved with you
So  either make sure youve built city walls in the vulnerable cities or delay metallurgy until its safe 
Another critical item in this period is Leonardos Workshop 
Since it instantly updates all your units as you get new capabilities  you not only need to have it  you also must not allow it in a rivals hands 
The Late Period    Civ Goes Modern This period is the most difficult to provide useful comments on  both because theres so much to comment on and because so much depends on how the game has gone until this point 
You may find yourself in the fortunate circumstance of being the only significant power left  or you may find yourself up against a major power with weapons as advanced as yours or about to build a spaceship in competition with yours 
The comments below are  therefore  fairly general in nature and     your
mileage may vary  
The Question of Government  
In my mind  the question of which government to choose finally gets easy  if Im in an extended war  then its Fundamentalism  if not  then Im in a Democracy 
The science trade production advantages of Democracy are overwhelming  but controlling the populace is difficult if you are going to have to have a significant army in the field  see however the Production City  
And even with the UN WoW  staying at war is difficult because of the interference by the Senate 
So  my approach is to switch to Democracy as soon as I have JS Bachs Cathedral and Womens Suffrage 
Normally Ill also wait until I have Statue of Liberty to avoid the 4 turn period of anarchy between governments 
After that  Ill trigger a revolt if I just need a turn to conduct a quick attack and then reinstate democracy 
If I expect a major war  a switch to Fundamentalism is in order 
The ten units per city with no support costs will allow for a rapid build up 
No unhappiness means not worrying about moving massive forces out of your cities 
And the tithes generated mean a large income that can be spent buying units and inciting cities to revolt  unless your opponent stays in a democracy  
However  staying in Fundamentalism is dangerous if you have a technological rival or an opponent whose technology is nearly equal to yours 
His science rate will stay high while yours drops with the 50% penalty 
Over time  this can become a serious problem  so as soon as the war is successfully over  I want to switch back to Democracy 
In any case  once whenever you make the switch to Democracy you need to reset your tax science luxury rates so that you generate a nice income  have advances every 1 3 turns and a luxury rate of 20 30% 
With that you should generate a quick series of  We Love the days which will cause your population to explode 
You also need to check the Attitude Advisor 
Any city with one or more unhappy faces should be checked to see what the cause is 
You may not be able to cure them all  but you dont want any nasty surprises later 
If things are peaceful  you may be able to move some units into cities to avoid the unhappiness 
And for the long term  if youve not already done so  now would be a good time to start setting up defensive fortresses on the perimeter of your empire  to defend it and serve as an  early warning network  
Remember that units inside fortresses that are within 3 squares of any friendly city dont create unhappiness 
Late Period Wonders  
See the table below also 
The bad news is that you really need nearly all the late industrial era and modern period WoWs 
The good news is that you may be able to get them because theres a reasonable chance youve gotten far enough ahead to beat your rivals to those you need 
The really critical ones are Hoover Dam and Womens Suffrage 
If you are going to try to fight a war while in Democracy  the you also need to put the UN on your  must have  list as well 
I consider Womans Suffrage a prerequisite to switching to Democracy  so that is the first of all the modern WoWs I go after 
The huge boost to production and reduction in pollution that results from Hoover Dam makes it a critical item as well 
Civic Improvements and Rise of the Skyscraper  
By now  your large cities are probably fighting three problems  citizen unhappiness  pollution and food supply 
Each problem can be controlled with some group of improvements and eventually youll need them nearly all of them 
Which ones are needed at any one time is simply a matter of reacting to the need  or even better  anticipating it 
For example  adding sewers will allow your cities to expand beyond size 12 but you might need a supermarket or harbor to have the food to fuel the growth and you may need mass transit to control the resulting pollution 
If you have significant military rivals  dont neglect things like coastal fortresses and city walls in ports and border towns if you dont already have them 
If they have advanced technology  consider SAM batteries 
Transportation can now be rapid and convenient 
At least one city on every continent should build an airport and  of course  all cities on each land mass should have railroads interconnecting them 
With that combination  you can move units anywhere you control essentially instantly 
Expansion in the Late Game  
Generally I find that my expansion through founding new cities slows dramatically late in the game for a variety of reasons 
For one thing  Im concentrating on growth within my cities and using my production for all those city improvements and not for making settlers engineers 
Also  theres normally little open land left on the map at this point  and even if I find some  my engineers are busy making lots of improvements to terrain rather than founding new cities 
However  I will found a few new cities in attractive locations that Ive not used before or just recently found 
The alternative method of expansion is to seize some or all of your opponents territory and cities 
The degree to which this is possible depends on just how dominant you are militarily and technologically 
At the one extreme  Ive found it often possible to reduce my opponents to a single civilization with one city which I tightly surround with fortresses and units 
At the other extreme  Ive also found myself fighting a major war with one rival while racing against another to get the spaceship built and launched 
The first situation will result in great scores  but the latter will result in great games 
Late Game Diplomacy  
My goal now is to become the dominate player on the map and the use of spies and diplomacy is important 
Generally Ill avoid  entangling alliances  now  but Ill choose carefully who Ill go to war with  not because they are a threat but because I cannot count on staying at war for long unless I switch to Fundamentalism 
Late Industrial Period and Modern Warfare  
Warfare at this point can be almost non existent or you can have an on going  global war that makes the real World Wars look puny in comparison 
If you are playing a game below King level  especially on a small map  you probably dont have any opponents who are a real threat militarily 
But at King level and higher  and often on large maps at any level  you may well find yourself with an opponent who has military technology nearly equal to yours 
The big difficulty in this time period is sustaining a large military force in the field while still in a Democracy 
As discussed above  one solution is to switch to Fundamentalism  a great idea if you anticipate the need for a massive buildup and an extended war 
However  the 50% loss in science production makes this an option Ill employ only if Im well ahead technologically and wont need the research to make building the spaceship possible 
The other obvious way is to stay in Democracy and simply gather 1 2 units from each city so that no one city is driven into disruption by the unhappiness 
However  this costs 1 2 shields for support in each of your cities and not all of them may be able to afford the loss of shields 
Another alternative is the Production City which really comes into its glory in this time period 
By maximizing the shield production in this city and placing the Shakespeares Theater WoW in it  you can make it the home for most  if not all  of your entire force 
This is especially advantageous for bombers and missile units because it avoids trouble from the unhappiness that such units will always generate otherwise 
A third alternative is to use hordes of Spies to do your conquest by inciting revolts 
But this wont work against a rival who is also in a Democracy 
In the modern period youll have a bewildering variety of units available and its not easy picking which ones you need 
Like Civ1  battleships are a dominant force in the first part of this period 
A Veteran Battleship combined with a transport load of some combination of riflemen  paratroopers  marines and armor can take virtually any port city on the map 
At least that is true if your opponent lacks battleships  bombers and cruise missiles 
When they become available  bombers are extremely effective for taking non port cities 
With a few bombers to knock out the defenders  the land forces will have little trouble taking most cities 
And since the bombers and howitzers can ignore city walls  these cities are now vulnerable 
Armor is useful throughout the remainder of the game with its good combination of speed and firepower 
When available  Mech 
Infantry units are the best defensive units both at home and away 
Paratroopers  marines and howitzers are specialized units that I only build if I have a particular need for them 
Like the real world  a few carrier battle groups can effectively control the Civ 2 seas 
Built around a carrier loaded with a mix of bombers and fighters  you want to include a sub or two  loaded with cruise missiles and or nuclear missiles    a battleship and several AEGIS cruisers  cruisers destroyers will do until you can build the AEGIS units  
The computer player will employ such groups as well  but he does not do a good job coordinating his units and employing their special abilities 
And he has the habit of stacking too many ships together  remember nukes generate no pollution at sea  so they are just the thing to take out that carrier and 3 cruisers the AI will stack together 
Go Nuclear  or Not 
Speaking of nukes  the Manhattan Project is the one WoW you might want to actively avoid 
If you get it  then any player with the technology can  and will  deploy nuclear weapons 
Once the genie is released you cannot control it 
And the computer players will show no more reluctance in nuking your cities than they do sending musketeers against your armor units 
If you can avoid having nuclear weapons appear in the game at all it will probably be to your advantage 
However  if you are certain that they are going to get them  then make sure you produce them too  they seem slightly less likely to use them if you also have some 
But just in case  start building SDI everywhere 
The one really useful way to employ nuclear weapons is at sea 
Carriers  and submarines especially  are very useful ways to control the seas when loaded with a few nuclear missiles 
Used on a rivals ships  they will destroy his navy while generating none of the pollution that will quickly become a problem if used on land 
The End Game  
Okay  youve survived and perhaps become dominant  or maybe not dominant but at least youve survived 
Now how to end the game and win 
Basically there are two ways to win of course  either eliminate all the other civs or be the first to successfully get the spaceship to Alpha Centauri 
If you can take the time and wish to expend the effort in maximizing your score  then youll want to  Eliminate all other civs except for one city of one other player 
It should not be a port  have no WoWs  and it should be surrounded by fortresses containing mechanized infantry 
Fill the map to the maximum extent possible with cities and transform most terrain for maximum food production 
Build all WoWs needed or not 
Keep the population as happy as possible 
Build the largest allowed spaceship  but wait to launch it so that it will arrive within the last few turns  or just before an opponents spaceship  
Pump up your science production so you are getting a  future tech  advance every turn 
If youve gotten here but theres another civ also building a spaceship  then you have to get there first 
Offensively  that means you have to slow him down 
Disrupt his production of components with spies  snatch a few cities away  whatever it takes 
You can go after his capital which might destroy his spaceship  but if he has the 1 000 in cash to pay for it  he can relocate his capital and barely miss a beat 
Defensively you need to build the spacecraft components quickly  every city not producing components should send caravans to those that are 
Disband the caravans  you lose 50% of the shields  but its better than nothing 
Also disband any military units you know you wont need  especially in the cities producing components  that frees up the support cost shields and adds 50% of their shield value when disbanded 
Finally  if you have to  maximize the engines and fuel on your ship  make sure you have fusion power for that bonus  while leaving everything else at the minimum  that could mean that your ship will be faster than his and get there first even if you launch second 
Special Cities  The Science City and the Production City In Civ 1 a technique that worked very  very well was to build the  Knowledge City  
This combined the Colossus and Copernicus Observatory Wonders in one city which would then generate tremendous trade and science rates 
Basically  this still works in Civ 2 although the effects are somewhat toned down unless you also add in some of the new Wonders 
However  the new Wonders also leave an opportunity to build another specialized city  the Production City 
In both cases  you will optimize the city site  its improvements and the Wonders built in them to maximize the production of  beakers  in one case and  shields  in the other 
In ideal circumstances its possible to have one city out producing ten to twenty other typical cities  thus giving a tremendous boost to your civilization 
Science City The objective here is to maximize the science output 
Since science production is related to trade  this also means maximizing the trade arrows in the city 
To do so  you need to  Pick a city with an good site 
Anything that increases trade arrows is good  an ocean port with fish or whales  forest with silk  mountain with gold  jungle with gems  etc  Avoid sites with multiple hills or mountains unless they contain a food trade special  grapes or gold are great tho  
Quickly add roads to every square that will benefit 
Since you are going to want to make this a large city  large city means more trade arrows   you also need lots of food  grasslands and the ocean specials 
To a certain extent you want shields  but beyond the need to support a settler and a few defensive units  that is secondary once we have Trade 
Then we can ship Caravans Freights in from everywhere to generate the shields when we need them 
Youre unlikely to find a ideal site in the first couple cities  so some compromises will be needed  but keep these guidelines in mind 
Build Colossus  adds 1 trade arrow to every square already having one or more  
Build Copernicus Observatory  50% increase in science production  
Build a library  another 50% increase in science production  
Set up 3 trade routes with the largest cities that you can find 
 Remember  the commodity traded influences the initial bonus but not the number of trade arrows  
Build a university  another 50% increase in science production  
Build Isaac Newtons College  doubles the science production  
Build the superhighway improvement  Replaces the Colossus WoW  
Build SETI Wonder anywhere  adds 50% to science production of all cities  
By the late game period it is not uncommon for the Science City  alone  to generate in excess of 300  beakers  per turn  and an advance on every turn 
Production City  
Like the Science City above  your goal is to maximize the output of a single commodity  only now its shields 
Doing so means  Pick a good site for the city 
Now were looking for anything that will boost shield production 
At least one coal  oil or iron ore site is really needed  although you can get by with a site that combines several hills or a hill and several forest squares 
Youll often end up with an inland site  but a production city that is also a port is a powerful advantage later since you can home your naval units there 
Food is a second concern since early on we want it to be self sufficient 
Later we can use surplus food from other cities to support this one  but at first  enough excess food will be needed to support those citizens working in the mines 
Mine one or two hills around the city and irrigate the grasslands to support the miners 
Build King Richards Crusade  adds 1 shield to any square already producing one  
Mine any remaining hills or mountains 
Add railroads to all squares with mines or forests  50% shield increase per square  
Build a factory here  50% increase in shield production  
Build pollution control improvements when available 
Build Hoover dam somewhere  50% increase in all cities  reduced pollution  
Build manufacturing plant here 
Build Shakespeares Theater here 
 No unhappy citizens  so home most or all your field army here   
Build a solar plant here 
Build offshore platform here if ocean squares available  1 shield per ocean square  
Under good conditions  the cumulative impact of this effort will be huge  you can often build any unit  any improvement  or any spaceship segment in a single turn and or you can field a large military force all supported from one city 
Put Shakespeares Theater in such a city and a Democracy can field a good sized army with no unhappiness 
Wonders of the World  
The following tables are my assessment of the various Wonders of the World in Civ II 
Any evaluation of them is likely to be controversial and there is no one  right  answer possible 
The  best  ones are those that serve your style of play and your goals best 
Your own expansionist vs  perfectionist  and war vs  peace choices are strong influences on whats best 
In addition  several of them are sensitive to the level at which you are playing  how many unhappy citizens youll have to deal with 
In a few cases  the priority of later Wonders is influenced by whether you got an earlier one or not  for example  if I missed Michelangelos Chapel  Bachs Cathedral will certainly be #1 on my list later  
While influenced by the thoughts and opinions of others  the comments below ultimately reflect my style of play and my normal objectives and   Your mileage may vary  
In general  these comments reflect an aggressive  but not necessarily militaristic style of play with an overall goal of maximizing my score by creating a large  prosperous civilization and ending the game very late with the spaceship 
A final note  dont overlook the fact that you can sometimes recover from not getting a key Wonder by capturing it 
And since Wonders add to your score  to maximize your point total you will want to control as many of them as possible at the end of the game
