building your first city .
at the start of the game , your civilization consists of a single band of wandering nomads .
this is a settlers unit .
although settlers are capable of performing a variety of useful tasks , your first task is to move the settlers unit to a site that is suitable for the construction of your first city .
finding suitable locations in which to build cities , especially your first city , is one of the most important decisions you make in the game .
in order to survive and grow , each city must have access to all three resource types : food -lrb- represented by grain -rrb- , production -lrb- represented by shields -rrb- , and trade goods -lrb- represented by arrows -rrb- .
the map in civilization ii is divided into individual "squares , " each of which contains a different type of terrain .
each terrain type yields resources in differing amounts .
a good city site provides all three resource types .
normally , the lines dividing the map squares are invisible .
to get an idea of how the terrain is divided , turn on the map grid by choosing show map grid from the view menu , or holding down c and pressing g. before you move your settlers , take time to examine the surrounding terrain .
you will note that only 21 map squares are visible .
this represents the extent to which your civilization has explored the world .
-lrb- this 21-square pattern is significant with regard to cities as well , as you will see later . -rrb-
the surrounding black areas represent unexplored terrain .
you can build a city on any terrain square except for ocean .
as mentioned earlier , each terrain type yields differing proportions of resources , so the type of terrain you choose for a city site determines the level of the city's success .
your settlers currently occupy a grassland square .
normally , grassland produces two grain when worked by one of your citizens .
note that a small shield symbol appears in the center of this particular grassland square .
that means that , in addition to its normal resources , this grassland square also yields one shield when worked .
normal grassland squares -lrb- without shields -rrb- appear to the northwest and northeast of your settlers .
directly to the north and directly to the west of the settlers are plains squares .
the plains terrain type produces one grain and one shield when worked by one of your citizens .
southeast , south , and southwest of the settlers are ocean squares , which produce one grain and two arrows each when worked .
surrounding the edge of the visible terrain are a plains square with a river running through it , two additional grassland squares , and four additional ocean squares .
there are also two hills squares and a mountains square along the northwest edge , two forest squares to the southwest , and an ocean square two squares to the southeast with a whale in it .
we'll look at these in a moment .
you have the option of moving around to find a suitable city site .
if the nearby terrain is less than optimal it is worth doing so , considering the importance of proper city placement .
you shouldn't waste too much time looking , however .
settlers move only one square per turn , and 20 years pass every turn this early in the game .
luckily , your starting position here is excellent : the local terrain provides a diverse resource mix , you are adjacent to a sea coast , and grassland squares make good city locations .
build your first city by selecting build new city from the orders menu , or by pressing the b key .
you can rename the city if you like , but we'll refer to it as washington .
examining the city display .
as soon as the city is built , a new window appears .
this window is called the city display .
the city display gives detailed information on the city's current status , including the amount of resources generated , the item currently being built by the city , and the size and attitude of the city's population .
your first priority is to check the status of the city's resources .
the population roster shows that there is one citizen in washington , and he is content .
under most circumstances , each citizen in the city is working in one of the terrain squares surrounding the city , generating resources for the city's use .
as new citizens are added to the population , the game puts them to work in the terrain square it considers the most productive available .
in this case , the city's single resident is producing resources in the ocean square that contains the whale .
you have the option of moving citizens to different terrain squares if you want to produce different combinations of resources .
as you can see by the icons on the resource map , the whale square is generating two grain , two shields , and two arrows .
click the whale square to "pick up" the citizen working there , then click on the plains square with the river running through it , directly to the east -lrb- right -rrb- of the city .
notice that , in the plains square with the river , the citizen now generates one grain , one shield , and one arrow .
click on the plains square with the river and then click on one of the forest squares southwest of the city .
in the forest square , the citizen generates one grain and two shields , but no arrows .
since the whale square is one of the most productive types of terrain , click on the forest square and then on the whale square to return the citizen to his original position .
as you can see , the combination of resources produced is based on terrain type .
under normal circumstances , each city can assign citizens to generate resources in any of the 20 terrain squares surrounding the city .
the pattern of 21 squares with the city at the center that is seen in washington's resource map is called the city radius .
in addition to the terrain squares in the city radius , the city square itself always generates resources .
like the squares worked by your citizens , the number and type of resources produced in the city square is dependent on the terrain type .
washington is currently generating four units of food .
each citizen requires two units of food each turn in order to survive .
excess grain icons accumulate in the food storage box .
the more surplus food the city generates , the faster it grows .
washington is also generating three shields .
shields represent raw materials used for supporting units and building new items .
since there are currently no units to support , the shields generated each turn go directly into the production box .
finally , the city is producing three arrows , which represent trade goods .
trade goods are divided into three separate categories : taxes -lrb- gold icons -rrb- , luxuries -lrb- goblet icons -rrb- , and science -lrb- beaker icons -rrb- .
currently , one arrow is being used to generate taxes , while the other two are generating science .
washington's improvements roster shows that the only building in the city is the palace .
your palace denotes that washington is your civilization's capital .
first priorities .
because there is so much information to assimilate at the start of the game , it's hard to know what you should do first .
there are four priorities that you must keep in mind early in the game : defense , research , growth , and exploration .
defense : your top priority is to defend washington from potential enemies .
after all , who knows who might be lurking in all that unexplored territory ?
to defend the city , you must build a military unit .
when the city is built , it automatically begins to construct a defensive unit .
the production box shows that washington is currently producing a warriors unit .
research : the science portion of your trade income is used to research new civilization advances .
civilization advances are new discoveries and technologies that allow you to build newer and better military units , city improvements , and wonders of the world .
growth : the surplus food generated by the city eventually leads to population growth .
when the food storage box is completely filled with grain , a new citizen is added to the population .
steady city growth leads to increased productivity and the ability to expand your civilization by building more settlers to colonize the continent .
exploration : if you don't explore the dark areas of the map , you have no way of knowing what benefits and dangers might be lurking there .
by using spare units to explore the world around you , you can discover the villages of minor tribes -lrb- which often provide you with benefits such as money and new discoveries -rrb- , sites for new cities , and neighboring civilizations .
when you're finished examining washington , close the city display by clicking the exit button in the lower right corner .
researching civilization advances .
after closing the city display , press the e key to end the turn .
at the start of the next turn , you are prompted to choose the first civilization advance you want to research .
when the game begins , your civilization has only minimal knowledge , usually consisting of only irrigation , mining , and roads .
-lrb- in some games you might be given additional advances at the start of the game , but in the tutorial this is not the case . -rrb-
the bulk of your knowledge throughout the game is gained through research .
there are many different strategies dictating the order in which advances are researched .
for the purposes of this tutorial , we'll adopt a conservative , defensive strategy .
you can experiment with research strategies of your own as you become more familiar with the game .
when the menu of possible advances appears , select bronze working , then click ok .
we have chosen bronze working because the discovery of this advance allows you to build the phalanx unit .
phalanxes are twice as effective at defending cities as warriors .
the amount of time required to research discoveries is based on the amount of science your city is currently generating .
remember , science is one of the components of trade .
select the trade advisor option from the advisors menu , or press the 5 key .
as you can see from this display , it currently takes five turns to make a new discovery .
the more beaker icons you generate each turn the faster you make new discoveries .
click ok to close the trade advisor window .
as you can see by looking at the status window , 20 years of game time pass .
-lrb- on chieftain level , turns start out spanning 20 years each .
as the game progresses , the turns get shorter , dropping to ten years per turn , then five , two , and eventually one year per turn . -rrb-
the amount of trade allocated to taxes , luxuries , and science can be adjusted to a certain degree to suit your needs .
select tax rate from the kingdom menu .
as you can see , there are three sliders in the tax rate window , each of which controls the percentage of one of the three elements of trade .
moving a slider left or right decreases or increases -lrb- respectively -rrb- the percentage of trade allocated to that element , and adjusts the other elements accordingly so that the total percentage equals 100 percent .
unlike civilization and civnet , civilization ii limits the maximum percentage of trade that can be allocated to taxes , luxuries , and science based on your civilization's government type .
you start the game in despotism , so the maximum percentage you can allocate to any trade element is 60 percent .
note that the game automatically sets science at 60 percent and taxes at 40 percent .
since your focus should be on research at this time , and you currently require no luxuries to keep your population happy , the default settings are fine for now .
close the tax rate window by clicking the ok button .
meanwhile , back in the city ...
now , let's take a look at what happened in the city after the first turn .
open washington's city display by clicking the city icon on the map .
several things have changed since you last looked inside washington .
first , the information in the title bar indicates that your treasury now contains 51 gold instead of the original 50 .
that is because washington is generating one gold coin of taxes each turn .
since there are currently no improvements in washington that require upkeep , the gold is added to your treasury for future use .
look at the food storage box .
it is no longer empty .
there are now two grain icons in it .
this is the surplus food that was generated by the city on the first turn .
it is stored in the food storage box for later use .
finally , look at the production box .
like the food storage box , it is no longer empty .
the three shields generated on the first turn were used to help build the warriors unit currently under production .
an alternate way to close the city display is to click on the button in the upper left corner .
use whichever method you find most comfortable .
your first unit .
until your warriors unit is completed , you have little to do .
press the enter key three times .
it is now the fourth turn , and you have just built your first military unit .
the warriors unit is now flashing on and off in the city square .
the unit is now ready to receive orders .
there are two things you can do with your first military unit .
you could use the unit to defend your city .
in most cases , it is unwise to leave a city undefended .
this is especially true if you know that an enemy unit is nearby .
however , early in the game , the world is sparsely populated , so you can take a chance and send the unit out to explore hidden terrain outside the city radius .
move the warriors unit to the west by pressing the 4 key on the numeric keypad .
note that one of the black , unexplored terrain squares is revealed when the unit moves .
most units can "see" one square in any direction .
your turn ends automatically when your last unit finishes its movement .
since warriors can move only one square per turn , your turn is now over .
your first civilization advance .
we'll go back to exploring the world in a moment .
for now , something more interesting has happened .
at the start of this turn , your scientists announce that they have discovered the secret of bronze working .
congratulations !
you have discovered your first civilization advance .
after the initial message of discovery , the civilopedia appears .
the civilopedia is an on-line encyclopedia of game facts .
the civilopedia screen that appears after the discovery of each advance shows the units , improvements , and wonders you can now build as a result of the advance , as well as new lines of research available .
bronze working allows you to build phalanx units and the colossus wonder , and allows you to research currency .
bronze working also allows you to research iron working , but only after you have researched warrior code .
close the civilopedia screen by clicking the exit button .
once again the list of research choices appears , allowing you to choose the next advance you want to discover .
since bronze working has provided the ability to build a good defensive unit , you can now move on to a research path that enhances your exploration capability .
choose horseback riding from the menu , and click ok .
changing production .
before you do anything else , its time to look inside the city again .
open washington's city display by clicking the city's icon on the map .
when you look at the production box , you'll notice that the city has automatically begun to build another warriors unit .
in fact , a city goes on producing unit upon unit until it receives orders to the contrary .
since the city is still defenseless , you need to build a unit to protect washington from possible invaders .
a phalanx is a better defensive unit than warriors , so that is what you should build .
click the change button above the production box .
when you do so , a menu listing the possible production options appears .
choose phalanx by clicking on it .
click ok to exit the production menu .
the phalanx's icon now appears above the production box to indicate that the city is now building a phalanx .
click exit to close the city display .
finding a minor tribe .
remember your warriors unit ?
it's flashing again , indicating that it is once again ready to move .
move the warriors one square to the west by pressing the 4 key on the numeric keypad .
note that , as the unit moves , any unexplored -lrb- black -rrb- terrain within one square of the unit is revealed .
press e to end the turn .
when the unit starts flashing again -lrb- indicating that it is the next turn -rrb- move it one square to the southwest by pressing the 1 key on the numeric keypad .
now here's something interesting !
your exploration has revealed a "hut , " one square to the southwest of the warriors' present position .
this hut is home to a minor tribe .
minor tribes are not rival civilizations ; rather , they are small villages populated with people who might be inclined to help you .
save your game by choosing the save game option from the game menu , or by holding down the c key and pressing s. you are about to make contact with the minor tribe .
the results of such contact are random .
you could receive a gift of knowledge or gold ; the tribe might band together to form a mercenary military unit and join you ; or the tribe might decide to honor you by establishing a new city in your empire .
of course it is possible that negative events might occur as well : the village could be empty , or populated by hostile barbarians .
by saving the game prior to contact , you have the option of reloading from the save if you don't like the results of exploring the village .
when the warriors start flashing again , move your unit onto the hut .
as stated earlier , one of a number of random events will occur as a result of contacting a minor tribe .
for the purposes of this tutorial , we'll assume that you receive a gift of gold from the minor tribe .
population increase .
continue your exploration for the next three turns .
move the warriors back toward washington , twice to the east , and once north , so you are right next to the city .
on this turn , two things happen simultaneously .
first , washington completes the phalanx it was building .
second , the population of the city increases to two , as indicated by the number next to the city's icon .
open washington's city display .
notice that the food storage box has only two food in it now .
next turn it will start filling up again , accumulating grain for the next population increase .
notice that the population roster now contains two citizens .
on the resource map , you can see that the new citizen is already at work generating resources ; specifically , the citizen is generating two grain and one shield in one of the grassland-shield squares to the north .
that's fine for now , so leave the citizen there .
as for production , its time to change again .
this early in the game , one defensive unit is more than adequate for city protection .
click the change button , and select settlers from the production menu .
its time to start thinking about the next priority : growth .
in order to expand your civilization , you need to build other cities ; and for that , you need settlers .
close the city display .
as noted on the production menu , it will take washington ten turns to produce a settlers unit .
you can speed this up a bit through the use of your warriors unit .
once the city display is closed , the warriors should be flashing .
move the warriors unit into the city , and re- open the city display .
in the center section of the city display you should see two icons : a phalanx unit and a warriors unit .
click on the warriors unit icon .
from the menu of options that appears , choose disband and click ok .
now , look at the production box .
five shields appear as soon as the warriors unit is disbanded .
when a unit is disbanded inside one of your cities , half of its original cost in shields is added to the production currently in progress .
close the city display .
now , back on the map , the phalanx is flashing .
in order to protect the city , the phalanx must remain inside washington .
units provide the best protection when they are fortified .
fortify the phalanx by choosing fortify from the orders menu , or by pressing the f key .
fortified units remain in their defensive position until you manually reactivate them .
for now , the phalanx should be left alone to guard washington .
interim .
because you have so few units and cities early in the game , there are often periods of time that pass without your having to take any action .
after fortifying your phalanx , press e two times .
at this point , your wise men discover horseback riding .
in addition to allowing the research of several new advances , horseback riding allows you to build horsemen , fast-moving military units that are great for exploration .
choose code of laws as the next advance to research .
for the purposes of this tutorial , our goal now is to develop trade .
in order to do so , you must research both code of laws and currency .
code of laws also leads to monarchy , a more advanced form of government that helps to increase your productivity .
continue pressing e .
about six turns later , you are notified that washington has completed the settlers it has been building .
choose the zoom to city option on the notification menu to open the city display .
once there , change production so that washington is building a horsemen unit .
you'll be using the horsemen to do some more exploration as soon as it's built .
you'll notice that washington's population has dropped to one .
that is because settlers units represent citizens that leave the city in order to improve the surrounding terrain or to establish a new city .
also , one of the three shields generated by the city is now being used for support .
that is because , under despotism , any units beyond the size of the city's population require one shield each turn to support them .
right now , you have two units , but only one citizen .
at any rate , the food storage box shows that the population is about to increase again , so these situations are only temporary .
close the city display .
expanding your empire .
now it's time to expand your empire .
move your settlers directly west until they reach the sea coast , then move them one square to the southwest .
use the build city command on the orders menu , or press b to build a new city .
again , you can name the city anything you want , but we'll refer to it by its default name , "new york."
when new york's city display opens , you'll notice a couple of differences from washington when it was first built .
although new york is generating just as much food as washington did , raw materials and trade goods generation are both significantly lower .
that's because there are no special resources , like whales , to take advantage of within new york's city radius at this time .
which brings us to another oddity : the entire city radius of new york is not visible .
that's because there is still some unexplored terrain nearby .
in order for the city to take advantage of its entire city radius , all the terrain therein must be explored .
you'll have to take care of that as soon as possible ; you never know what useful resources might be lurking in the dark .
notice that new york is currently producing a phalanx .
since this city needs to be protected too , a phalanx is just what you want .
close the city display .
after a couple of turns pass , the horsemen unit is completed in washington .
when the horsemen unit appears , open washington's city display , and click the change button .
since you have enough units for the time being , and you aren't quite ready to incur the upkeep expense of a barracks , let's build your first wonder of the world .
choose colossus from the production menu , and close the city display .
meanwhile , let's go and explore that hidden terrain near new york .
move your horsemen west , toward new york .
notice that horsemen have twice the movement capability of the other units you've used so far .
that's why they are so good for exploring .
as you move toward new york , your wise men make another discovery : code of laws .
when you are offered the choice of what to research next , choose currency .
on the next two turns , move the horsemen southwest .
halfway through the second turn's movement , the horsemen should reach the coast just south of new york , revealing several new terrain squares .
one of these is a whale .
-lrb- remember how productive that was back in washington ? -rrb-
maybe it is inside new york's city radius ...
open new york's city display .
the entire city radius is now visible ; and you're in luck !
the whale square is inside the city radius .
click the grassland square northeast of the city to "pick up" your worker , then click the whale square to put him to work again .
note that new york's resource generation has now significantly increased .
close the city display .
move your horsemen directly east until you reach the forest on the coast west of washington .
notice that your unit only gets to move once when moving into a forest .
that's because it takes two movement points to move into forest squares .
because of their rugged features , many terrain types require more than one movement point in order to move through them .
now , move your horsemen east , past washington , until you get to the river .
then , proceed roughly east-southeast , following the coast .
after your horsemen unit is several squares past washington , the phalanx in new york is completed .
fortify the phalanx , just as you did in washington , and change the production in new york to settlers .
as you continue to explore , your horsemen might encounter one or two minor tribes .
when you discover currency select trade as your next research project .
save the game again , and enter these villages just as you did the first time you met a minor tribe .
restart from the saved game if you don't like the results .
meeting another civilization .
if you continue along the coastline as instructed , you eventually meet your nearest neighbors , the sioux .
their capital city , little bighorn , is located some distance away , on the opposite coast directly southeast of washington .
as soon as you enter sioux territory , their leader , sitting bull , requests an audience with you .
accept sitting bull's invitation by clicking ok .
establishing effective communication with your neighbors is vital to your success .
early in the game , you should take any reasonable actions to ensure that nearby civilizations enjoy your company .
not only does this keep your civilization reasonably safe from attack , it can also lead to profitable exchanges of money and information .
you can see your opponent's attitude toward you when you make contact with one another .
the attitudes of rival leaders are based on your past behavior when dealing with other civilizations .
since this is your first contact with any civilization , sitting bull should have a fairly good attitude when you first meet -lrb- "cordial" at the very least -rrb- .
the most likely result of this encounter is that sitting bull will offer to exchange knowledge or sign a peace treaty .
whatever sitting bull offers , accept his proposals .
notice that each time you agree to his proposals , sitting bull's attitude steadily improves .
this is important , because you want to make friends at this stage in the game .
if sitting bull's attitude is particularly good -lrb- "enthusiastic" or "worshipful" -rrb- , offer to suggest a permanent strategic alliance with the sioux .
a permanent alliance is better than a treaty , because it allows both civilizations to move freely through one anothers territory .
whether the alliance is accepted or rejected , end the meeting by choosing consider this discussion complete and clicking ok .
if the alliance was rejected , move your horsemen unit away from little bighorn as soon as possible to avoid violating the peace treaty .
if you establish a reputation of violating peace treaties , your opponents are less likely to sign agreements and treaties with you in the future .
after this encounter , you have gained a friend -lrb- for now -rrb- , and possibly one or two free civilization advances as a result of technology exchange with the sioux .
now that you have made contact , you can chat with sitting bull at any time by selecting the foreign minister option from the advisors menu , and sending an emissary to the sioux .
sitting bull can also contact you at any time .
you shouldn't pester your opponents too frequently , however , because rival leaders quickly grow weary of interruptions .
if you are contacted by the sioux at any time during the remainder of this tutorial , agree to their demands .
during the tutorial game , you want to keep the sioux happy so they won't attack you .
during a real game , use your own judgment as to how to respond to an opponent's demands .
improving the terrain .
continue exploring with your horsemen to the northeast of little bighorn .
avoid entering little bighorn's city radius , because this will be viewed as a violation of your peace treaty .
after a number of turns , your wise men discover trade .
select ceremonial burial as your next advance .
if you already have ceremonial burial -lrb- as a result of knowledge exchanged with the sioux -rrb- , select monarchy .
several turns later , new york finishes building its settlers .
open new york's city display and click the change button .
notice that there are now several more options on the production menu : the discovery of code of laws allows you to build a courthouse , and the discovery of trade allows you to build caravan units .
select caravan , and close the city display .
when the settlers unit becomes active , move it one square to the northeast of new york -lrb- using the 9 key on the numeric keypad -rrb- , onto the grassland-shield square .
for the next couple of turns , keep exploring with the horsemen , but skip the settler's turn by pressing the z .
continue to do this until new york's population has increased to two .
when this happens , open new york's city display .
when you look at new york's resource map , you see that the grassland-shield square northeast of the city is currently generating one shield and two grain .
that's not bad , but you can use your settlers unit to improve the production in that terrain square .
close the city display .
when the settlers becomes active , choose build road from the orders menu , or press the r key .
for the next couple of turns , the settlers unit spends its time building a road .
when the settlers become active again , you see on the map that there is now a road leading out of new york to the northeast .
now , open new york's city display again and look at the resource map .
notice that , after the construction of the road , the same grassland- shield square is now generating one trade good icon in addition to its former resources .
in addition to this benefit , roads increase movement speed : units only expend one-third of a movement point to move along a road , no matter what type of terrain the road occupies .
close the city display .
believe it or not , the terrain can still be further improved .
when the settlers become active again , choose build irrigation from the orders menu , or press the i key .
building irrigation takes a bit longer than building roads .
while you're waiting for the settlers to complete their task , you discover another civilization advance .
if you just discovered ceremonial burial , select monarchy as your next advance .
if you just discovered monarchy , select writing as your next advance , and choose not just yet ...
when you are offered the chance to start a revolution to change governments .
several turns later , the settlers complete their irrigation project ; the terrain square is now marked to show that it is irrigated .
open the city display for new york .
notice that the resource production has not changed as a result of irrigation .
normally , this would not be the case : irrigation usually increases the grain output of grasslands by one .
however , under despotism , your current system of government , any terrain square producing three or more of any resource type has its production reduced by one .
so , instead of three grain , the square still produces only two .
this illustrates the drawbacks of despotism , and explains why your research is now proceeding toward monarchy , where such penalties do not exist .
close the city display .
while you're waiting for the next advance to be discovered , use the settlers unit to build a road between new york and washington .
move one square toward washington and build a road .
continue until you have connected the two cities .
this will facilitate fast travel between your cities .
after the road is built , use the settlers to start improving the terrain around washington .
establishing a trade route .
shortly after you start building your inter-city road , the caravan in new york is completed .
you'll be using this caravan to establish a trade route between new york and little bighorn .
trade routes increase the amount of trade goods generated in both their home city and the city with which the trade route is established .
trade routes also give the caravan's home city a cash and science bonus on the turn when the route is established .
each city can operate up to three separate trade routes .
after you are notified of the caravan's completion , a menu appears listing the possible trade goods that the caravan can carry .
select each commodity in turn , and click the supply and demand button to review what cities traffic in that item .
if little bighorn demands one of the items on your list , select that item and click ok .
otherwise , select any item and click ok .
you get both the trade increase and a cash and science bonus no matter what your caravan carries , but the cash and science bonuses are bigger if you supply goods demanded by the destination city .
confirm your choice by clicking confirm and zoom .
when new york's city display appears , change the city's production to marketplace .
the marketplace improvement increases both tax and luxury output in new york .
as soon as the caravan becomes active , start moving toward washington .
it takes a while to get to little bighorn , because a caravan moves at a rate of one square per turn .
it's worth the trip , though .
the farther away the destination , the higher your cash and science bonus .
en-route to washington , you discover another civilization advance -lrb- monarchy or , if you're ahead of the game , writing -rrb- .
for now , don't declare a revolution .
select your next advance : writing -lrb- if you don't already have it -rrb- or map making .
we'll come back to monarchy shortly .
you will , in fact , discover another advance before your caravan reaches little bighorn .
this time , choose map making -lrb- if you don't have it -rrb- or warrior code .
meanwhile , back on the trade route , your caravan reaches washington .
move the caravan into the city .
when the caravan enters washington , you get a list of options .
you can establish a trade route with washington -lrb- which you don't want to do -rrb- .
you are also given the option to help build wonder .
-lrb- remember , washington is still in the process of building the colossus . -rrb-
if you were to choose this option , the caravan would be disbanded , and 60 shields would be added to the production of the colossus .
this is an excellent way to accelerate the construction of wonders of the world which , obviously , take quite a long time to build .
for now , however , your goal is to establish a trade route with little bighorn .
choose keep moving and click ok .
continue moving the caravan until you reach little bighorn , then move the unit into the city .
choose establish trade route from the menu .
you have now established your first trade route !
a message appears telling you how much money you receive as an immediate bonus .
an equivalent number of beakers is added to your current research project at the same time .
open new york's city display .
note that the trade route is now listed in the bottom center portion of the city display , and that new york's arrow production has increased as a result of the trade route .
changing governments .
by now , you have established a small , but thriving , civilization .
you are doing well , but you could do better .
the last thing you'll learn in this tutorial is how to improve your civilization by switching to better forms of government .
open new york's city display .
note that the city is currently generating six grain , five arrows , and four shields -lrb- assuming that the trade route with little bighorn is generating one arrow .
your actual number of arrows might vary slightly . -rrb-
close the city display .
now , it's time to change governments .
select the revolution !
option from the kingdom menu and confirm your choice to overthrow the government .
within a few turns , a menu appears listing the systems of government currently available to you .
choose monarchy and click ok .
your civilization is now ruled through a monarchy .
the tax rate window appears , giving you the opportunity to reset your division of trade between taxes , luxuries , and science .
note that your maximum rate is now capped at 70 percent and close the window .
now , you'll make discoveries more quickly .
let's take a look at the effects of the government change .
open new york's city display .
look at the production changes .
the city's grain production has increased from six to eight .
note that the grassland-shield square you irrigated earlier is now generating three grain instead of two .
the other extra grain is coming from the city square itself -lrb- it is automatically irrigated when the city is built -rrb- .
trade has also increased as a result of the change in government .
the whale square is now generating one additional arrow .
this has the effect of increasing the number of beakers from three to four .
shield generation has remained the same because none of the terrain currently in use around new york is capable of producing more than two shields under the present circumstances .
if you look at the city display for washington , you'll notice similar increases in that city as well .
conclusion .
so ends the tutorial .
you should now be familiar with many of the basic concepts of civilization ii .
feel free to continue playing the tutorial game and see how you do , or go back and start a new game on a randomly generated world .
remember , you have only scratched the surface when it comes to learning the game .
use the rest of this manual and the on-line civilopedia in the game to help you with new concepts as you encounter them .
the basics of cities .
when you start a game of civilization ii , your settlers unit stands on a terrain square surrounded by the darkness of the unknown .
though you can choose to let this single group of settlers -lrb- if you're really special , you could possibly have two settlers units -rrb- wander the world alone , that's not the point of the game .
as soon as you've found a decent site , you want your settlers to build a permanent settlement — a city .
you must build at least one city , because only cities can produce new units , allowing your civilization to grow and develop .
you'll probably build a dozen or more cities over the course of the game .
cities are the residences of your population , the sources of tax dollars , and the homes of your scientists .
each city organizes the development of the area surrounding it , harvesting the nearby agricultural land , natural resources , and potential trade goods , then converting these resources into food , industrial production , technology , and cash .
one way to measure the success of your civilization is by the number and size of the cities you have built or captured .
larger cities collect more taxes , conduct more technological research , and produce new items faster .
civilizations with small numbers of cities and small city sizes risk being overrun by larger and more powerful neighbors .
gaining new cities .
you can acquire new cities in three ways .
most frequently , you build them with settlers units .
if you are aggressive , you can conquer the cities of your neighbors .
occasionally , you can gain a city when a minor tribe discovered by your units elects to join your civilization .
founding new cities .
the most common way to gain new cities is to send out settlers to tame the wilderness .
in fact , you start the game with a settlers unit whose primary task is to found your first city .
the terrain under and around your city is important , so if you want to select the best possible place for your metropolis , skip down to choosing your location .
if you want to jump right in , choose a square with rivers , plains and/or grasslands near it .
when your active settlers unit stands on the square where you wish to build a new city , choose the option build new city from the orders menu .
if you accidentally build a city by mistake , you can select the cancel button on the name city screen to retrieve your settlers unit .
your advisors propose a name for the new city ; you can type in a different name if you prefer something else .
when you are satisfied with the name , press e or click the ok button .
the city display opens so that you can arrange the city's initial production and economic development .
when the display closes , your new city appears on the map .
the settlers unit disappears , having converted into the first citizens of your new city .
choosing your location .
when building a new city , carefully plan where you place it .
citizens can work the terrain surrounding the city square in an x-shaped pattern -lrb- see city radius for a diagram showing the exact dimensions -rrb- .
this area is called the city radius -lrb- the terrain square on which the settlers were standing becomes the city square -rrb- .
the natural resources available where a population settles affect its ability to produce food and goods .
cities built on or near water sources can irrigate to increase their crop yields , and cities near mineral outcroppings can mine for raw materials .
on the other hand , cities surrounded by desert are always handicapped by the aridness of their terrain , and cities encircled by mountains find arable cropland at a premium .
in addition to the economic potential within the city's radius , you need to consider the proximity of other cities and the strategic value of a location .
ideally , you want to locate cities in areas that offer a combination of benefits : food for population growth , raw materials for production , and river or coastal areas for trade .
where possible , take advantage of the presence of special resources on terrain squares -lrb- see terrain & movement for details on their benefits -rrb- .
proximity of cities .
another consideration when planning new cities is the current or potential location of other cities .
you want to minimize the chance that one city's radius overlaps another's .
since a map square can only be used by one city at a time , radius overlap restricts the potential growth of one or both cities .
explore nearby lands as soon as possible to begin planning the placement of future cities .
you want to take best advantage of the terrain .
of course , the geography of your particular continent will limit your choices .
if you find yourself on a small island , your potential city sites will necessarily be more crowded than if you can sprawl across a vast continent .
strategic value .
the strategic value of a city site is a final consideration .
a city square's underlying terrain can increase any defender's strength when that city comes under attack .
in some circumstances , the defensive value of a particular city's terrain might be more important than the economic value ; consider the case where a continent narrows to a bottleneck and a rival holds the other side .
good defensive terrain -lrb- hills , mountains , and jungle -rrb- is generally poor for food production and inhibits the early growth of a city .
if you need to compromise between growth and defense , build the city on a plains or grassland square with a river running through it if possible .
this yields decent trade production and gains a 50 percent defense bonus .
regardless of where a city is built , the city square is easier to defend than the same unimproved terrain .
in a city you can build the city walls improvement , which triples the defense factors of military units stationed there .
also , units defending a city square are destroyed one at a time if they lose .
outside of cities , all units stacked together are destroyed when any military unit in the stack is defeated -lrb- units in fortresses are the only exception ; see fortresses -rrb- .
placing some cities on the seacoast gives you access to the ocean .
you can launch ship units to explore the world and to transport your units overseas .
with few coastal cities , your sea power is inhibited .
capturing cities .
other civilizations normally defend their cities with one or more military units -lrb- armies for short -rrb- , and sometimes with the city improvement city walls .
a defended city flies a pennant showing its owner's color .
a walled city is surrounded by a short wall .
there are two ways to acquire enemy cities : force and subversion .
if you choose force , you must destroy the defenders by successfully attacking with your military units .
once the city is undefended , you can move a friendly army into the city and capture it .
if you prefer subversion , you must successfully bribe dissidents in the city with your diplomat or spy unit -lrb- and sufficient funds — see diplomats & spies for all the details on such espionage -rrb- .
the dissidents capture the city for you , as their armies automatically convert to your side .
once captured , the city becomes yours to control and manage as you would any other .
capturing an enemy city can also lead to side benefits , such as the discovery of a new technological advance and plundered cash to add to your coffers .
capture , however , eliminates one point of population -lrb- unless the city walls , which can prevent this loss , are still standing -rrb- .
therefore , when your units enter a city with only one point of population remaining , it is destroyed instead of captured .
diplomats and spies can incite dissidents -lrb- see diplomats & spies -rrb- to capture a city without reducing its population below one .
occupation of an enemy city destroys roughly half of the improvements the city has built , including all temples and cathedrals .
certain military units , such as fighters and bombers , are also destroyed rather than captured .
capture does not affect wonders of the world -lrb- though , of course , destroying a city does — see wonders of the world for more details -rrb- .
inciting revolt creates less damage to the city , as the dissidents rely less on bombardment , and their familiarity allows them to pinpoint targets more accurately .
a city captured by revolt loses only the temple and cathedral improvements -lrb- if it had them -rrb- .
converting minor tribes .
as your units explore the world , they might encounter the villages of minor tribes — civilizations too small or too peripatetic to count as "settled" -lrb- see minor tribes for the scoop on these situations -rrb- .
minor tribes react to contact with a range of emotions , from delight to hostility .
occasionally , a minor tribe is sufficiently awed by your emissaries to immediately form a new city and become part of your civilization .
move your exploring unit onto the village icon to discover the tribe's attitude towards your civilization .
if they choose to form a new city , you need do nothing : your advisors propose a name for the new city -lrb- which you can change if you prefer something else -rrb- .
when you are satisfied with the name , press e or click the ok button .
the city display opens so that you can arrange the city's initial production and economic development .
when you close the display , your new city appears on the map .
the village icon is replaced by the new city square , and members of the tribe settle in as the first citizens of your new city .
the parts of a city .
the city square .
the terrain a city occupies is especially important because it is always under development .
you can not take workers off of this square when adjusting resource development on the resource map -lrb- see resource map in reference : screen by screen -rrb- .
if this area is not useful , especially for producing food , then population growth in the new city is handicapped .
for this reason , you'll find new cities do best when they are built on plains or grasslands squares or squares with rivers .
these terrain types provide the best food production and , thus , faster population growth .
note that all beginning civilizations possess the technologies of building roads , mining , and irrigation .
when you found a city on a plains , grassland , hills , or desert square , -lrb- or the special terrains based on those types -rrb- including squares with rivers running through them , the city square is automatically improved by roads and irrigation .
when you found a city on any other type of terrain , the city square is automatically improved by roads and , if applicable , mining .
you can not assign a settlers or engineer unit to further improve a city square by , for example , adding mining or railroads , regardless of terrain , although you can change the terrain to another type -lrb- forest to plains , for example -rrb- .
move a settlers or engineer unit into the city square and check the orders menu to see what changes are possible .
city squares do automatically improve with the discovery of certain advances .
the city radius .
the potential area of development , called the city radius , extends two map squares out from a city in every direction except vertically or horizontally .
since the development area only extends one square from the city square in these directions , the resulting "radius" actually looks like a fat x , not like a circle .
if the city grows large enough , its citizens can bring all of this area into development .
when planning a new city , consider the long-term benefits of all the terrain squares within this radius .
for the city's population to increase , the radius must encompass terrain that workers can cultivate to produce food .
your -lrb- potentially -rrb- most important cities also have raw materials available .
these cities can quickly build and support military units and wonders .
hills and forests allow your citizens to produce good quantities of raw materials , as do squares containing special terrain icons -lrb- pheasants , buffalo , coal , fish , and others — see special terrains for complete details -rrb- .
the importance of trade in generating taxes and civilization advances makes river squares especially good sites for cities early in the game .
where you have no rivers or coastal areas , you can generate trade by building roads on plains or grasslands .
when a square within your city radius is outlined , it indicates that another city is claiming that terrain's resource production .
it could be one of your cities , if the city radii overlap .
if you own both cities , you can flip between resource maps to adjust production in each to the best benefit of both locations .
it could also be a rival city that one of your opponents has built close to you .
finding an outlined square in your city's radius might even lead you to discover a rival city in unrevealed territory or outside of your units' observation range .
managing your cities .
once you've founded , captured , or gained a city , you need to direct its growth and production .
each city has different assets and demands , so each should be managed individually .
you must keep several goals in mind when managing a city : maintaining population growth , maximizing a useful mix of economic development -lrb- food , raw materials , and trade -rrb- , producing tax revenue , producing technological research , and producing useful units and improvements , all the while maintaining an attitude of contentment and thereby avoiding civil disorder .
for cities to grow and prosper , they need to balance economic output with the citizens' needs for infrastructure and services .
city management concepts .
as your city increases in size , its population expands , and it produces more and more food , shields , and trade .
these represent your city's basic resources : edibles , raw materials , and trade goods .
in city management , you add another layer of concepts which address how you turn these materials into products you can use .
refer to the city display as you read .
grain feeds your population and supports the city's units .
when a city produces more food than its population and units consume each turn , the excess accumulates in the food storage box .
when the box is full , another citizen is added to the population roster , and the city increases in size .
if your city is not producing enough food each turn to feed its population , the shortfall is noted , and stores are removed from the food storage box .
if the box empties , any units that require food for support are disbanded , one by one , until a balance is achieved .
if your city still experiences a shortfall , one citizen is removed from the population roster , and your city decreases in size .
shields power your industrial capacity and support the city's units .
when a city produces more shields than your units expend each turn , the excess shields accumulate in the production box each turn .
when the production box is full , your city produces something .
it can "build" one of three kinds of things : units which move around the map -lrb- like settlers and chariots -rrb- , city improvements which are tied to specific cities -lrb- like libraries and aqueducts -rrb- , and wonders of the world , which give unique benefits to the civilization that builds them -lrb- like the pyramids or magellan's expedition -rrb- — but more about these details later .
the type of government your people develop and the distance remote cities are located from your palace affect your shield production .
sometimes raw materials can be lost to waste .
you can read all about the details of waste under trade management concepts .
if your city runs short of the raw materials it requires each turn , one or more units -lrb- that it supports -rrb- are forced to disband .
the units farthest from home are disbanded first .
based on the tax rates you set , trade arrows are further divided into three commodities that your civilization acquires : luxuries , taxes , and science .
these commodities each have their own icons : luxuries are represented by goblets , taxes are represented by gold , and science or research is represented by beakers .
the type of government your people develop and the distance remote cities are located from your palace affects your trade income .
sometimes trade can be lost to corruption .
you can read all about the details of trade transactions under trade management concepts .
population growth .
keeping a city's population growing is important because each additional citizen contributes something to your civilization .
each new citizen brings a new terrain square under production in your city radius until there are no empty squares to work .
after this point , each new citizen becomes an entertainer -lrb- see specialists for details on what entertainers do -rrb- .
thus , population growth increases your economic power , and concurrently , the strength of your civilization .
the size of your population is a major factor in determining your civilization score , and is a measure of how well you have ruled .
resource development .
the citizens of a city that work the surrounding countryside harness the economic resources within the city's radius .
depending on the needs of your civilization , there might be times when you prefer increased industrial output from a particular city over population growth .
at other times , you'll want increased trade revenues .
still other times , sheer population growth might be the most important goal .
you can manipulate the output of a city by reassigning workers on the resource map .
each terrain square that shows resource icons is being worked by a citizen .
click on one of those squares , and you take the citizen off work .
an entertainer icon -lrb- a little elvis -rrb- appears at the end of the population roster .
now click on an empty terrain square .
elvis disappears from the population roster and resources appear in that square , indicating that a citizen is now working there .
by experimenting with the placement of workers on the resource map , you can find the optimum production ratio of food to raw materials to trade for that city .
having an entertainer on your population roster might change the attitude of one or more of your citizens .
for more information on this reaction , see happiness & civil disorder .
tax revenue .
the percentage of your trade that is converted into tax revenue , or gold icons , is determined by the tax rate you set — see trade rates for information on how to manipulate the ratios of taxes , science , and luxuries .
why do you need tax revenue , anyway ?
you need revenue , or cash , because most improvements you build within cities require a stipend of gold for maintenance .
gold is also useful for speeding industrial production -lrb- see rush jobs -rrb- , bribing enemy armies or inciting revolts in enemy cities -lrb- see diplomats & spies -rrb- , and for negotiating peace with your neighbors -lrb- see diplomacy -rrb- .
the combined tax revenues of all your cities must exceed their combined maintenance requirements before gold can accumulate in your treasury .
it is not necessary for each city to have a positive cash flow .
however , enough cities must do so to cover your civilizations' expenses , or your treasury will be depleted to cover the deficit .
you can watch your status window or check with your trade advisor to see if you have a surplus or a deficit , as we'll explain under advisors in reference : screen by screen .
some cities might not be especially suited for industrial production because of terrain or other factors .
but they might still be good trading centers , and capable of generating lots of income .
develop these locations with roads -lrb- and later , railroads -rrb- , trade routes -lrb- see caravans & freight for the lowdown on trade route bonuses -rrb- , city improvements like marketplace , bank , and stock exchange , and wonders to be your civilization's cash cows .
if you get to the point where you are no longer interested in building new items in a location , you can use the capitalization improvement to convert a city's shields into gold — see the civilopedia entry for details. technological research .
the greater the research contribution each city makes toward new civilization advances , the faster your people discover each new advance .
the science rate you set determines the amount of research done in each city -lrb- see trade rates for the essentials of adjusting the ratios of science , taxes , and luxuries -rrb- .
a city's research contribution can be influenced by adjusting the city's total trade income — research is a fraction of trade — by creating scientists -lrb- see specialists -rrb- , and by building certain city improvements .
improvements that can help are the library , university , and research lab which all increase research , and several wonders .
the civilization advances chapter goes into detail about how to read the advance tree , so if you want the nuts and bolts , flip there next .
industrial production .
your most valuable cities can be those with the greatest industrial capacity — those whose workers produce the greatest number of shields .
these cities can quickly produce expensive military units with which you can extend the power of your civilization .
they are also best at producing wonders of the world , as wonders generally cost immense numbers of shields .
but city management is dynamic .
you must regularly monitor the production of your cities to ensure you are building the items you most need .
several factors influence a city's production of shields : the terrain within your city radius is most important , as citizens working on some types of terrain produce no shields at all -lrb- see terrain & movement for further explanations -rrb- .
you might find it worthwhile to set settlers -lrb- and later , engineers -rrb- to improving the terrain squares within your city radius so that they yield more or different resources -lrb- see settlers & engineers for examples of what improvements they can make -rrb- .
beyond terrain , the form of government your civilization chooses can cause each city to spend some of its raw materials as maintenance for the military units that call the city home .
it is possible that you can have so many units drawing raw materials from a city that there are no surplus shields .
in a city where this is the case , progress on the item under construction -lrb- unit , improvement , or wonder -rrb- stops until the situation is resolved .
a number of strategies allow you to adjust industrial capacity .
the simplest is to shift citizens working on the resource map so that they produce more shields -lrb- see resource development for instructions -rrb- .
you can also use settlers or engineers to improve a terrain square within the city radius so that it yields more shields .
or , order settlers units to build a new city -lrb- they'll no longer draw support from the city that sponsored them when they've settled their own town -rrb- .
you might also try reassigning units so that they are attached to a different city -lrb- see homing units for the low down on how to do this -rrb- .
within each city , you can order the construction of improvements such as a factory , hydro plant , or offshore platform that increase shield production .
several wonders also affect shield output .
consult the civilopedia for the complete list of possible city improvements and wonders .
it shows the construction and maintenance cost of each item , its purpose , and what advance is required to make it available .
city protection .
great economic management of a city is worthless if the city is captured by rivals or barbarians .
therefore , part of your management plan must concern the defense of each city .
the minimum city defense is one army , preferably one with a good defense factor .
a second defender can provide back-up in case the first is taken out -lrb- see military units for details of combat -rrb- .
an army with a strong attack factor is also useful .
this unit can strike at enemies that move adjacent to the city , perhaps destroying them before they can launch an attack .
fortify any armies that you expect to defend a city -lrb- choose the fortify option from the orders menu or press the f key -rrb- because fortified units gain an increased defense strength — as we'll explain more fully under military units .
a city's defense can be substantially increased by building city walls , an improvement that triples any defender's strength against most attackers -lrb- although not against howitzers or air units -rrb- .
veteran status and terrain bonuses are figured in before this tripling takes effect .
city walls also prevent population loss when defending units are destroyed -lrb- see combat -rrb- .
when civilization advances make available new army types with better defense factors , take the first opportunity to replace old defenders with better units .
since the offensive capability of your enemies improves as they acquire new advances , your defenses must improve to keep up .
linking cities with roads and railroads can be very helpful in speeding the movement of units from one end of your empire to trouble spots elsewhere .
this puts your defensive armies on "interior lines , " allowing them to move rapidly to where they are needed .
improvements .
city improvements represent the commercial , bureaucratic , educational , and public works infrastructure that make large and efficient cities possible .
in the real world , new york city's dense population depends on the extensive subway system for transportation , and buys electrical power generated by distant grids .
los angeles is located in a desert and pipes in much of its water from sources hundreds of miles away .
in civilization ii , improvements are also critical to the growth and importance of cities .
inadequate provision of these facilities can limit the potential size of a city .
each improvement provides some service or otherwise makes a city work more efficiently .
you must choose which improvement to implement at what time — does your city need a marketplace or a library more ?
would a courthouse provide more benefit than a colosseum ?
city improvements are listed alphabetically in the civilopedia .
it explains the building costs , benefits , and maintenance fees of each improvement , along with any conditions which make the improvement obsolete or non-functional .
losing improvements .
improvements are not invulnerable , nor are they guaranteed to be permanent fixtures in an ever-dynamic city .
the barracks improvement , for instance , has a planned obsolescence .
once your civilization discovers the advance of gunpowder , your old barracks is rendered obsolete , and it disappears .
-lrb- the same result attends your discovery of combustion .
these military installations are sensitive to changes in technology . -rrb-
to regain its benefits each time , you must rebuild a barracks improvement in each city you desire to have one .
most improvements don't disappear over time , but they can be vulnerable to capture , fire sale , and sabotage .
if you're really strapped for cash , you can even sell a city's improvements .
capture .
some , all , or none of a city's improvements might be destroyed when it is captured by another civilization .
when a city is completely destroyed , all improvements are destroyed as well .
fire sale .
if you have less money in your treasury than is needed to pay a city improvement's maintenance cost at the beginning of your turn , civilization ii automatically sells the improvement for cash .
deficit spending is not allowed — even if by the end of the turn you would have had a positive cash flow again .
sabotage .
foreign diplomats or spies can enter one of your cities and attempt industrial sabotage -lrb- of course , your envoys can attempt to sabotage your rivals' cities , too -rrb- .
this might result in the destruction of an existing improvement -lrb- or it might scrap the item that city is currently producing — see diplomats & spies for complete details on diplomatic actions -rrb- .
there are two defenses against this type of attack — destroying the diplomat or spy before he or she can enter your city , or stationing diplomats or spies of your own in the city for counterespionage .
selling improvements .
to raise cash , click on the improvement in the improvements roster of the city display .
a dialog box shows how much gold you could receive for selling the improvement .
normally you can gain one gold per resource invested in construction .
if you sell , the improvement disappears from the city and the money is added to your treasury .
selling improvements can be useful when you are short of money and are threatened with the random sale of an improvement .
it can also be useful when you are under attack with no reasonable chance of defending or recovering a city .
by selling off its improvements , you reduce its value to the enemy and salvage something .
you can sell only one improvement per turn in each city .
you can not sell wonders of the world .
rush jobs .
there are also times when you need the specific benefits of an improvement right now , and not 20 turns down the line .
if you have sufficient funds , you can rush completion of a partially built item by paying cold , hard cash .
however , speeding construction in this manner costs a premium .
when workers are rushed , they receive overtime wages , and must pay surcharges on material delivery and fabrication .
the surcharges for a rush job depend on what proportion of the work is already completed , whether the job is civil or military or a wonder , and can cost up to eight times as much gold as the normal accumulation of shield icons .
to rush a job without paying cash , you have two options .
any caravan or freight unit can enter a city where a wonder is under construction and deliver its goods specifically to the project by choosing the help build wonder option when it arrives .
it contributes the unit cost in shields directly to the resource box .
alternatively , any unit that disbands in a city contributes one-half its unit cost in shields to the current construction , whether it is a wonder , an improvement , or another unit .
this represents the retraining of troops and redisbursement of their supplies .
items completed by rush jobs are available at the beginning of your next turn , so there is no advantage for rushing items that would be complete on the next turn anyway .
to judge whether an item can be completed next turn without rushing , compare the surplus raw materials the city is generating to the number needed for completion .
for very expensive items , it might be useful to consult your city status advisor from the advisors menu for an exact count of the remaining cost .
managing your trade .
trade is a fundamental force driving civilizations .
it introduces unique and exotic valuables , stimulates the economy , and fires the imaginations of a culture's foremost thinkers .
the effects of trade permeate society in many surprising and subtle ways , and your ability to direct trade's impact is likewise varied .
trade management concepts .
taking up where we left off in city management concepts , these are the further divisions that result from trade income -lrb- arrow icons -rrb- : luxuries -lrb- goblets -rrb- , taxes -lrb- gold -rrb- , and science funding -lrb- beakers -rrb- .
luxuries make your population more content .
the availability of luxuries means that some citizens can enjoy a more pampered existence .
every two goblets make one contented citizen happy .
we'll talk more about happiness a little later .
taxes maintain city improvements and add to your treasury .
taxes support basic city services , and surplus funds accumulate in your treasury .
there are plenty of useful ways to spend money in civilization ii , as we'll explain in a little while .
if funding dries up , your city might be forced to sell off improvements .
research funding powers your technological research .
each new advance requires the accumulation of a certain number of beakers to achieve .
the civilization advances chapter explains the details of the search for knowledge , but for now , you just need to know that new discoveries often allow you to build new units and city improvements , and sometimes open up the possibility of building wonders of the world .
in addition , each discovery leads to further discoveries , creating a chain of progress .
if your cities don't produce many beakers , your civilization doesn't progress very fast .
which of these three is the most important ?
that varies according to what you want to achieve right now .
to give trade management the most flexibility , civilization ii lets you adjust the proportion of trade income that is devoted to each of these three areas .
the tax rate option on the kingdom menu lets you change the ratio of taxes to science to luxuries by ten percent increments , and also shows you how these rates affect your funding and the speed at which your knowledge increases .
in city concepts , we mentioned that the population roster can tell you more than just the number of citizens in your city .
it can also tell you your citizens' general level of contentment .
citizen icons appear in three different attitudes : happy , content , and unhappy .
when you start building cities , you start with content citizens .
the type of government your civilization develops and the level of difficulty at which you chose to play affect how rapidly unrest begins to trouble your populations .
unhappy citizens must be balanced by happy citizens , or your city falls into civil disorder .
not only does civil disorder sound bad , it has all sorts of nasty consequences , as we'll explain shortly .
for now , you need to know that you can increase the happiness of your citizens several different ways , among them : building specific city improvements like temples and marketplaces -lrb- we'll explain all about improvements shortly -rrb- , reassigning military units -lrb- the dirt about martial law and foreign service effects appears under military units -rrb- , adjusting the tax rates -lrb- as we'll discuss under kingdom menu in reference : screen by screen -rrb- , and pulling citizens off production work to make them specialists -lrb- see specialists for the skinny on this -rrb- .
phew !
that's a lot of stuff to digest all at once .
just one more thing — we mentioned types of governments two paragraphs ago .
discovering new advances encompasses more than just new gadgets to improve sanitation and military might .
the game counts philosophical concepts and theories as "new technologies , " too .
every civilization starts out as a despotism , but you can develop new forms of government .
these might , in turn , have a profound effect on the happiness of your citizens and the rate at which your citizens produce raw materials , food , and trade .
trade rates .
when you start a new game of civilization ii , none of your trade benefits are tied up in luxuries — instead , 40 percent of your trade goes toward revenue from taxes , and 60 percent of it is funneled into science .
to change the proportion of tax and science income , pull down the kingdom menu and choose the option tax rate .
choose a new rate by sliding one or more of the buttons along the slider bars .
a notation at the top of the box mentions the maximum any one percentage can be , given your current form of government .
another notation lists the income and outflow as gold per turn , and finally , an entry calculates how many turns it will take to achieve a new advance .
if you are interested in focusing on civilization advances , you might want to increase the amount of science being conducted .
if you rapidly build city improvements , you might want to increase your taxes to cover the maintenance costs .
if you are concerned about the attitude of your citizens , you might want to increase the availability of luxuries to make your citizens happier -lrb- we'll explain all about happiness in a few moments -rrb- .
experiment with different rates to see what levels of income and science you can achieve .
if it is difficult to adjust all three sliders at once , you can click the box at the right end of any bar to lock that value in place .
now only the other two sliders move when you drag on one .
governments .
another tool of city — and trade — management is the type of government under which your culture operates .
every civilization starts out as a despotism , but some of the advances you can research are intellectual in nature , rather than technological , and these include five new governmental concepts .
once you have discovered a new form of government , you can choose to sponsor a revolution in order to change government types .
-lrb- you can also gain access to new forms of government by building the statue of liberty wonder . -rrb-
anarchy , or the lack of government , occurs only when you lose control , either because civil unrest topples your current government , or immediately following a revolution .
civil unrest continues as long as conditions are ripe for it .
in the case of a revolution , your people's attitude naturally stabilizes .
after a few turns , once your civilization settles down , a dialog box appears listing all the possible forms of government your culture has available .
choose the one you like , and that regime takes effect immediately .
a new feature in civilization ii lets you change governments instantaneously and without penalty for the remainder of this turn .
if your first choice turns out to be unsatisfactory , pull down the menu again and select a different government .
once you press e to end your turn , you must go through the entire revolution process -lrb- including several turns of anarchy -rrb- if you want to change governments again .
there are three "ancient" forms of government — despotism , monarchy , and the republic — and three "modern" ones — communism , fundamentalism , and democracy .
the republic and democracy are the most sophisticated from an economic point of view , but they impose severe restrictions on your military forces .
the other forms offer trade-offs between economics and increased military flexibility .
in essence , you could summarize governmental variants this way : the more freedom you give your people , the less they will want to fight for you , but the stronger your economy will become .
we've collected the details of each form of government's bonuses and drawbacks in regard to trade , support provided to units , production , and the attitude of the citizenry .
depending on your style of play , you might not develop each advance in order of sophistication .
anarchy .
you have temporarily lost control of the government .
you continue controlling the movements of your units , and cities continue to operate on their own , but some important functions of your civilization grind to a halt until control is restored .
attitude : up to three troops in each city can institute martial law ; each makes one unhappy citizen content -lrb- see happiness & civil disorder -rrb- .
corruption & waste : corruption is rampant .
although no maintenance is charged for city improvements , no tax revenue is collected and no scientific research is accomplished while anarchy continues .
resource support : military units do not require raw material support until the number of units making a city their home -lrb- see unit roster -rrb- exceeds the number of citizens on the population roster .
each military unit in excess of the city's population points requires one shield for industrial support .
settlers require one food for support each turn .
special conditions : while anarchy continues , citizens can not work up to their potential .
the penalty for this atmosphere of tension is that workers produce one fewer resource icon in any terrain that can generate more than two icons of any one kind .
mines , for example , which might normally be worked for three shields , only output two under anarchy .
despotism .
you rule by absolute fiat .
the people just have to live with it because your will is enforced by the army .
due to the severe limits on economic and personal freedom , production is at a minimum .
but total control makes conducting war relatively easy .
attitude : up to three troops in each city can enforce martial law ; each makes one unhappy citizen content -lrb- see happiness & civil disorder -rrb- .
corruption & waste : corruption and waste are both major problems under despotism .
trade income losses due to corruption and shield production losses due to waste increase with the distance a city is located from its capital .
resource support : under a despotism , military units do not require resource support until the number of units making a city their home -lrb- see unit roster -rrb- exceeds the number of citizens on the population roster .
each military unit in excess of the city's population points requires one shield for support each turn .
settlers require one food for support .
special conditions : citizens can not work up to their potential .
the penalty for this atmosphere of tension is that workers produce one fewer resource icon in any terrain that can generate more than two icons of any one kind .
mines , for example , which might normally be worked for three shields , only output two under despotism .
in addition , the maximum rate at which you can set tax , luxury , or science production is 60 percent .
monarchy .
your rule is less than absolute , and an aristocracy of upper-class citizens influences your decisions .
the aristocratic classes , at least , have a certain amount of economic freedom , and this results in the potential for greater production .
your feudal vassals are partially responsible for helping to defend your kingdom , but they may in some cases deduct a share of your civilization's production as maintenance for military units .
attitude : up to three troops in each city can institute martial law ; each makes one unhappy citizen content -lrb- see happiness & civil disorder -rrb- .
corruption & waste : a certain amount of your economic output is siphoned off by your aristocrats , particularly those farthest from your watchful eye — corruption and waste are significant problems under a monarchy , though not as severe as they are under despotism .
trade income losses due to corruption and shield production losses due to waste increase with the distance a city is located from its capital .
resource support : your feudal vassals support up to three units from each city at no cost to you .
each additional unit requires one shield per turn .
settlers require one food per turn for support .
special conditions : under a monarchy , the maximum rate at which you can set tax , luxury , or science production is 70 percent .
republic .
you rule over an assembly of city-states formed from the cities that your civilization controls .
each city is an autonomous state , yet also is part of the republic which you rule .
the people feel that you rule at their request .
they enjoy substantial personal and economic freedom , and this results in greatly increased trade .
a senate reviews your diplomacy , and has a chance to override your decisions .
military conflict is unpopular among the masses , and your government must bear the full cost of supporting its army .
attitude : each ground and naval unit beyond the first that is not stationed in a friendly city or in a fortress within three squares of a friendly city -lrb- except units whose attack strength is zero -rrb- , and each bomber , stealth bomber , helicopter , or missile unit — regardless of the city it occupies — makes one citizen unhappy each turn .
note : in civilization ii , units are not penalized based on their home city ; they need only be in any friendly city .
corruption & waste : corruption and waste remain a problem under a republic , though not as severe as they are under a monarchy .
trade income losses due to corruption and shield production losses due to waste increase with the distance a city is located from its capital .
resource support : each military unit requires one shield for support each turn .
settlers require two food per turn .
special conditions : under a republic your workers produce an extra arrow icon in any square where they are already producing at least one .
your senate can force you into accepting a peaceful resolution to any negotiation , though it will only choose to do so roughly 50 percent of the time .
finally , the maximum rate at which you can set tax , luxury , or science production is 80 percent .
communism .
you are the head of a communist government , and you rule with the support of the controlling party .
although this form of government allows more production than despotism , the orthodoxy of the party restricts personal and economic freedom , limiting trade .
on the positive side , corruption is negated by the action of the local party apparatus , the army and secret police suppress most dissent , and your large security forces recruit excellent spies .
attitude : up to three troops in each city can enforce martial law ; each makes two unhappy citizens content -lrb- see happiness & civil disorder -rrb- .
corruption & waste : under communism , state control of the economy eliminates organized crime , and none of your cities suffer corruption or waste .
resource support : regardless of city size , each military unit beyond the third a city supports requires one shield each turn .
settlers require two food for support .
special conditions : all spy units produced under communist governments are veterans .
under communism , the maximum rate at which you can set tax , luxury , or science production is 80 percent .
fundamentalism .
fundamentalism is a form of government based on the literal , forceful , and uncompromising interpretation of religious dogma .
fundamentalist societies maintain that their own beliefs are the only true path to salvation , and tend to be rigidly intolerant of any dissenting view — a fact which tends to choke off intellectual development .
on the other hand , the people in such societies are often fanatically devoted to their beliefs , and may be willing to die , use force , or commit great atrocities to preserve them .
this unthinking devotion , often obnoxious to neighboring societies , can be harnessed by a clever and cynical leader .
attitude : under fundamentalism , no citizen is ever unhappy !
improvements that normally convert unhappy citizens to content citizens produce "tithes" -lrb- gold -rrb- equivalent to the number of people they would normally convert , and require no maintenance .
corruption & waste : fundamentalism has very low rates of corruption and waste .
resource support : because of your people's zeal , each city can support ten military units at no cost to you .
settlers eat two food per turn .
only fundamentalists can build fanatic units , which never require support .
special conditions : under fundamentalism , tax/luxury/science rates can not be set higher than 80 percent .
in addition , the rigidity of mindset and emphasis on doctrine means that all scientific research is halved .
the diplomatic penalties for "terrorist acts" -lrb- such as bombing city improvements , poisoning wells , and so forth -rrb- committed by diplomats and spies is reduced , since the world comes to expect no better .
democracy .
you rule as the elected executive of a modern democracy .
the people feel that you rule because they chose you .
the degree of freedom allowed under this government results in the maximum opportunity for economic production and trade .
however , the people also have a very strong voice in determining how much economic production is devoted to improving the standard of living .
any diplomatic decisions you make are subject to review by your senate — and the senate always opposes actions that would lead to war .
maintaining a military force in the field comes with great political and economic costs .
attitude : each ground and naval unit not stationed in a friendly city or in a fortress within three squares of a friendly city -lrb- except units whose attack strength is zero -rrb- , and each bomber , stealth bomber , helicopter , or missile unit — regardless of the city it occupies — makes two citizens unhappy in its home city .
note : in civilization ii , units are not penalized based on their home city ; they need only be in any friendly city .
in addition , democracy is fragile .
if even one of your cities remains in civil disorder for more than a turn , your government collapses into anarchy .
corruption & waste : one of democracy's greatest advantages is its ability to squelch corruption and waste .
neither exists in your cities .
resource support : each military unit appropriates one shield for support each turn .
settlers require two food for support each turn .
special conditions : under democracy , your workers generate an additional arrow icon wherever at least one already exists .
patriotism and strong democratic traditions make your cities and units immune to all forms of bribery .
finally , the senate can force a peaceful resolution to any negotiation , and will do so whenever possible .
happiness & civil disorder .
happiness and its inverse state , civil disorder , are indirectly related to trade .
lack of trade leads to stagnation , and a slow economy means a lack of goods and services .
the citizens in your cities have one of three different attitudes or emotional states : happiness , contentment , or unhappiness .
the first citizens of your first city start out in a contented state .
as the population of the city grows , competition for jobs , commodities , and services increases .
eventually , depending on the difficulty level at which you play , the form of government your civilization employs , and the economic conditions in your city , some citizens start to grumble and display unhappiness .
if you don't take an active role in city management as population increases , the natural trend of citizens' attitudes is toward unhappiness .
so what can you do to counter this trend ?
if your population is already suffering civil disorder because of an attitude imbalance , you need to take immediate steps , as we suggest under restoring order .
however , you needn't wait until a crisis occurs ; you can keep citizens content by taking a longer outlook and providing services as the demand becomes imminent , or even ahead of demand .
the temperament of your citizens depends on the level of difficulty at which you play .
at chieftain level , your people are so even-tempered that the first six citizens on the population roster start out content .
each new citizen above this number starts with a bad attitude , and must depend on improvements , luxuries , martial law , and/or wonders of the world to improve his or her state of mind .
the number of citizens who start content decreases by one with each successive level of difficulty , until at deity level , your people are so temperamental that only one citizen starts out content .
the second and subsequent citizens show their unhappiness , and must be cajoled into better humor with any of the management tools at your disposal .
special unhappiness factors .
there are two special conditions that cause further unhappiness in some populations .
under a despotism , and to a progressively lesser degree under other types of government , citizen unhappiness increases with the number of cities .
this can lead to very unhappy citizens who must be converted first to unhappy citizens before they can become content .
in republics and democracies , each ground or naval unit not in a friendly city or fortress within three squares of a friendly city , and each bomber , helicopter , or missile unit regardless of where it is located , might create unhappy citizens .
you can think of it as units "in the field."
because of their routine flight training , most air units are always "in the field , " but the protective role of fighters makes them an exception to the rule .
in a republic , the first unit in the field does not cause discontent .
each subsequent army in the field creates one unhappy citizen .
if your civilization is a democracy , each unit in the field causes two unhappy citizens .
units with an attack strength of zero -lrb- that is , an adm rating that starts with zero , like transports and engineers -rrb- do not cause unhappiness in this manner .
when a city is in disorder , disbanding distant military units , returning them to their home cities , or changing their home cities can make some unhappy citizens content and might restore the city to order .
civil disorder .
as we mentioned in city management concepts , cities that don't maintain a favorable balance of happy people over unhappy people go into civil disorder .
cities in civil disorder produce no tax revenue , technological research , or food surpluses , and the condition suspends production .
prolonged civil disorder might bring down a government , and throw your civilization into anarchy .
a nuclear reactor in a city suffering civil disorder might experience a meltdown due to lax safety controls -lrb- see nuclear meltdown -rrb- .
keeping a city stable is a very high priority .
a city suffers civil disorder when unhappy people outnumber happy people .
content people and specialists are ignored in the calculation .
when order is restored , the city returns to normal operation the next turn .
you can restore order in several ways .
restoring order .
you can pay to complete an improvement , such as a temple , that can convert sufficient unhappy citizens to contentment -lrb- or content citizens to happiness -rrb- to restore the balance .
see rush jobs for instructions on how to do this .
you can also change the tax rates of your civilization .
increasing the availability of luxuries might convert some content people into happy citizens , allowing them to balance the unhappy populace .
see trade rates for information on economic manipulation .
you can take one or more citizens out of the work force , and make them specialists .
this increases the number of happy people .
for information on how to do this , see specialists .
when creating specialists , be careful not to also cause shortages of food or resources that trigger starvation of the population or the scrapping of armies .
if your civilization operates under anarchy , despotism , monarchy , or communism , you can use martial law to restore order to a city .
up to three military units , each with an attack factor of one or more , can be stationed in a city to enforce martial law .
each military unit makes one unhappy citizen in a city content under the first three types of government .
when you are operating under communism , martial law is doubly effective , and each army makes two citizens content .
if you have enough military units to enforce it , and a low enough level of unhappiness , martial law might be enough to restore order .
we love the _____ day .
if a city's population becomes sufficiently happy , it -lrb- not your whole civilization — just this one location -rrb- spontaneously holds a celebration in honor of your rule .
the people declare a "we love the -lrb- title of the leader -rrb- day" in thanks for the prosperity your management has made possible .
while the circumstances that support this celebratory mood continue , the city enjoys certain benefits , depending on your civilization's type of government .
you will see the effects of celebration begin on the first full turn that a city celebrates , that is , the turn after the party is announced .
to trigger a celebration day , a city must fulfill certain conditions : there can be no unhappy citizens in the city , there must be at least as many happy citizens as content citizens , and the population roster must number at least three citizens .
specialists are considered content citizens for this calculation .
for example , a city with five happy citizens , four content citizens , and no unhappy citizens celebrates .
a city with ten happy citizens , three content citizens and one unhappy citizen does not .
anarchy .
the celebration has no effect when your government is in anarchy .
despotism .
the celebrating city collects resources as if its government is a monarchy -lrb- see governments -rrb- .
this can increase the amount of food and raw materials your citizens can produce in certain improved -lrb- irrigated and mined -rrb- terrain types .
monarchy/communism/fundamentalism .
a celebrating city currently ruled by any of these governments collects resources as if its government is a republic -lrb- see governments -rrb- .
this increases the amount of trade your citizens can produce in any terrain that generates trade goods .
republic/democracy .
a city currently ruled by either of these governments increases in population by one point each turn it celebrates , so long as sufficient food is available .
this can result in dramatic growth of the city .
terrain and movement .
terrain & movement concepts .
the game map in civilization ii is divided into small independent parts , or terrain squares , as we mentioned in city concepts .
for simplicity , each square consists of a single type of terrain , even though the real world is not as perfectly organized as that .
to represent that some types of terrain are easy to walk across and others require slogging through mud or hacking through thick underbrush , your units spend movement points to enter each new square .
every unit has an adm rating -lrb- the acronym stands for attack/defense/movement -rrb- ; the m , or third number in the rating , indicates how many movement points it can spend in a turn .
you can find out all about units and their adm ratings under military units .
each terrain type has its own movement point cost -lrb- and they're all conveniently listed in the terrain charts on the poster -rrb- .
your settlers or engineer units can improve -lrb- that is , lower -rrb- these movement point costs by laying roads and later railroads in terrain squares -lrb- see settlers & engineers for the lowdown on how they do this -rrb- .
when a unit moves into a new square , it pays that square's movement point cost .
if it has any movement points — or fractions of movement points — left after moving one square , a unit can attempt to move again until it reaches the limit of its movement points .
attacking counts as movement — that is , your units spend movement points to attack .
you can read about the details under military units ; what you need to know here is that a unit's attack strength might be reduced if it has less than a full movement point remaining at the time of combat .
you'll get a message asking if you want to continue with the attack .
the proximity of enemy units or cities can also restrict a unit's movement options .
units and cities have what in military circles is called a zone of control ; their influence extends into the eight squares that immediately surround them .
your units can not move directly from one rival's zone of control into another's zone of control unless you have an alliance with the second tribe .
this represents a unit's ability to threaten or pin down enemy troops nearby .
when an enemy legion is nearby waiting to pounce , your troops can not afford to expose their vulnerable flanks .
the blockers don't have to be units or cities of the same civilization .
the movement restriction diagram should make it clearer , so give it a look-see .
some units -lrb- such as diplomats , caravans , and all air and naval units -rrb- have special abilities that allow them to ignore these restrictions .
types of terrain .
the differences in terrain are deeper than a variety of artwork and colors to make the game map more visually interesting .
each type of terrain has its own economic usefulness , effect on movement , and effect on combat .
detailed information about the terrain types is provided in the terrain chart on the poster , and from the civilopedia .
to get terrain information from the civilopedia , click on the civilopedia menu , and select the terrain types option .
a list of both standard terrain types and their special resources appears .
if you don't recognize the icon for a special resource , click on the standard terrain type to see what special resources are possible .
a note about rivers .
in civilization ii , rivers are not a type of terrain unto themselves .
instead , they can flow through any type of terrain .
rivers make movement easier for ground units that follow the line of the river bed either up- or downstream , because each square costs only one-third of a movement point , regardless of the underlying terrain .
settlers and engineer units can not build roads across rivers until your tribe discovers the bridge building advance .
rivers count as sources of water for the purposes of irrigation .
citizens working terrain through which a river flows gain a bonus arrow icon , representing the ease with which rivers facilitate trade .
finally , a river's presence enhances the defense bonus of the terrain through which it flows .
standard terrain squares .
the standard types of terrain can be divided along climactic lines .
here's a short summary .
glacier and tundra squares are both cold terrain .
neither produces much in the way of raw materials , and neither can be converted into more profitable terrain .
swamp and jungle are both wet terrain .
neither is easy to move through , and it costs a considerable investment of time to convert either into more profitable terrain .
plains and grassland squares are both open terrain .
both are easy to travel across , and when improved , both produce substantial amounts of food as well as other raw materials .
hills and mountains squares are both vertically challenging .
they take some effort to travel across and yield more raw materials when developed by mining .
ocean squares generate substantial amounts of trade , and appropriate types of terrain bordering them can be irrigated .
ground units can move at a rate of one-third of a movement point per square if they follow a riverbed up- or downstream .
desert squares are dry terrain that can be developed for marginal production .
forest squares are difficult to travel through , but yield decent raw materials .
special terrain squares .
each standard terrain square can be enhanced by one of two types of special resource .
where special resources appear , they add significantly to the economic value of the terrain .
distinct symbols mark the location of these resources .
if your settlers or engineer units convert a square containing a special resource icon into another terrain type , the original specialty is lost .
if the new terrain type can be enhanced by special resources , it is ; if the new terrain is grassland , it remains a standard terrain .
right now , we'll give you a brief summary .
glaciers can be enhanced by oil deposits , representing increased mineral wealth , and therefore yielding extra shields when worked .
alternatively , the presence of walruses indicate the availability of ivory , with its greatly enhanced trade goods yield .
musk ox stand in some tundra squares , indicating excellent food sources or the potential for good grazing ; workers in these squares can produce additional food .
other tundra squares display fur , indicating the high potential for arrows because of desirable trade goods .
swamp squares can contain peat , whose usefulness as fuel is indicated by the enhanced shield yield , or perhaps spice , exotic flavorings which are prized the world over , and therefore represent bonus yields in both food and arrow icons .
gems shine in jungle terrain to indicate the presence of precious stones , ivory , spices , salt , or other valuable commodities .
these are good trade items and , therefore , the square in which they appear generates substantial arrows .
jungles also have the potential to produce exotic fruits which naturally increase the food output .
buffalo trotting across the plains represent raw materials on the hoof ; workers in these squares generate extra shields .
on the other hand , grain represents a particularly fertile piece of open ground , and a rich source of food .
coal deposits , shown as black lump icons in hills terrain , represent rich locations of coal or metal ores .
these areas produce greatly increased shields , especially when mined .
on the other hand , some hills are wine country , especially suited for growing grapes .
wine terrain yields greatly increased trade .
gold gleams in mountains terrain , representing a bonanza of precious metal ore .
the value of these deposits produces tremendous trade goods .
alternatively , workers might discover iron deposits in mountainous areas , yielding a substantial number of shields .
fish swimming in ocean terrain represent the location of underwater banks and reefs where currents and nutrients create excellent fishing grounds .
fishing grounds produce increased amounts of food .
on the other hand , whales indicate the bounty of the deeps , and an increase in raw materials and trade goods as well as foodstuffs .
an oasis is a very fertile island in desert terrain where workers can harvest substantial quantities of food .
conversely , oil , representing the presence of mineral wealth , especially petroleum , can also be found in desert squares .
as they do in glaciers , oil squares in desert terrain yield extra shields when worked .
a pheasant peers through some forest terrain .
the presence of game indicates excellent food sources available .
on the other hand , silk represents a luxurious product of mulberry forests that brings increased yield from trade goods .
optimal city sites .
the economic usefulness of the various terrain types is important when selecting city sites .
citizens work the terrain within a city's radius to produce the food , raw materials , and trade that the city needs to grow and be productive -lrb- see the city radius -rrb- .
some terrain types are more valuable than others , in that citizens working them produce more resources .
other terrains start out yielding little , and only develop their full potential when they are improved .
these squares can be irrigated , mined , or surfaced for increased economic value .
other squares are important because they can be converted into more valuable terrain , as we'll discuss soon -lrb- for instructions on how to irrigate , mine , surface , and convert terrain , see settlers & engineers -rrb- .
the best city sites offer immediate food , raw material , and trade production , plus the potential for long term development .
terrain conversion .
when surveying sites for a new city , keep in mind the potential for terrain squares within the city's radius to be improved .
hills and mountains squares can be mined so that citizens working them produce increased raw materials .
plains and grassland squares , whether or not rivers run through them , can be irrigated so that citizens working there produce more food .
swamp and jungle squares can be cleared to yield grassland or planted to yield forest .
forest can be cleared to yield a plains .
plains and grassland squares can be retimbered to yield forest if you need raw materials .
an area dense with jungle and swamp squares looks barren at first , but has the potential to become a very rich city site .
improvements are not limited to agricultural effects .
settlers and engineers also improve terrain by laying roads across terrain squares .
roads allow better access to a city , and therefore , increase the trade goods citizens working some squares produce .
plains , grassland , and desert squares all produce trade once penetrated by roads .
railroads eliminate the movement point cost of the terrain across which they are laid and might increase resource production as well .
for more information on terrain improvements , see settlers & engineers — they're the units that do the work .
planetary caretaking .
manipulating terrain to produce the maximum number of shields has a downside , of course .
one cost of heedless industrial growth is a gradual polluting and poisoning of the environment .
of the many dangers posed by pollution in the real world , the greatest might be global warming .
theorists believe an unchecked rise in the planet's atmospheric temperature threatens catastrophic geographic changes including melting polar ice caps , rising sea levels , and parched farmlands .
different threats of poisoning occur if nuclear weapons are detonated or a nuclear reactor melts down .
civilization ii models pollution from industry and nuclear disaster as a balancing factor for growth .
as you steer your civilization into the industrial age , you must manage your cities and monitor your terrain to minimize pollution and prevent the disaster of global warming .
pollution .
every turn , the game assigns a probability of pollution occurring within the economic radius of each city .
the likelihood of this contamination depends on two factors : the number of shields produced -lrb- industrial pollution -rrb- and the population supported -lrb- smog -rrb- .
in some cities , industrial pollution is the major factor in the calculation , and in other cities smog is a bigger hazard .
below a certain level , the chance of pollution is negligible , but as industrial output builds , so does the likelihood of its darker side effects .
smog has no effect on pollution calculations until your civilization acquires the advance of industrialization .
smokestacks begin appearing on the city display in the general information window when the combined pressures of smog and industrial pollution begin to create a significant threat of contamination .
the number of stacks roughly indicates the probability each turn of a square within the city radius becoming polluted .
for example , a city generating a large number of raw materials each turn -lrb- say 20 -rrb- and inhabited by a large population might show several smokestacks in its city display .
the exact proportion of smokestacks produced by industrial pollution and smog depends on the difficulty level at which you set the game .
certain city improvements can help the situation .
a nuclear power plant , hydro power plant , solar plant , or recycling center improvement in a city reduces the impact of industrial pollution , in turn decreasing the accumulation of smokestacks .
solar plants also help prevent global warming by absorbing excess heat in the atmosphere .
the hoover dam , a modern wonder of the world , acts as a hydro power plant for all friendly cities .
the mass transit improvement eliminates smog .
nuclear contamination .
the detonation of nuclear weapons or the meltdown of a nuclear power plant can also cause contamination .
for game purposes , civilization ii treats these threats identically to industrial pollution , though in real life their effects might be considerably longer term .
nuclear weapons .
a nuclear unit not only destroys the army or city it targets , but all units stacked with the target , and those in adjacent squares as well .
it also pollutes a number of map squares around the impact square .
enemy units' zones of control -lrb- which are discussed under movement restrictions -rrb- might make it impossible for your settlers or engineer units to clean up this contamination in a timely fashion , and your rival might not spend the time or manpower .
unchecked pollution significantly raises the risk of a global warming disaster .
nuclear meltdown .
if a nuclear power plant melts down , half of the city's population is destroyed .
additionally , some random number of squares near the city become polluted .
the risk of meltdown always exists when a city which has a nuclear power plant goes into civil disorder .
civilian unrest might result in safety procedures becoming so lax that a catastrophic accident occurs .
if you build nuclear power plants in any of your cities , take special care not to allow those cities to go into disorder .
when your civilization achieves the technological advance of fusion power , the risk of meltdown disappears .
your nuclear plants automatically convert to fusion-powered facilities once you have achieved this advance .
pollution's effects .
pollution is represented graphically by a skull on the terrain square in which it occurs .
it reduces the production of food , raw materials , and trade to one-half -lrb- rounded up -rrb- of pre- pollution levels .
for example , a square where workers produced four food , one shield , and two trade before pollution blighted the square yields only two food , one shield , and one trade after contamination .
once the terrain is detoxified , workers' production returns to pre-pollution levels .
polluted terrain can be detoxified by any settlers or engineer unit .
the working unit's shield is marked with a "p" to note it has been ordered to detoxify a polluted square .
after four turns of work -lrb- an engineer can clean up in two -rrb- , the pollution disappears .
adding more settlers or engineer units to a polluted square speeds the cleanup .
if you use the goto city order , your city list marks which locations suffer from pollution .
note that a polluted square within the radius overlap of two cities is listed once for each city ; if your cities are close together , this might give you an alarming overstatement of the total pollution your civilization suffers .
monitoring pollution .
your environmental advisors inform you immediately when any map square within your territory becomes polluted .
a skull appears on the polluted square .
you can monitor the extent of pollution throughout your civilization by watching the pollution indicator , a small icon in the status window .
the color of the icon depends on the number of currently polluted terrain squares and the number of turns they have remained contaminated .
it indicates the extent of the risk of global warming .
global warming .
global warming might occur at any time that at least nine map squares , anywhere in the world , are polluted .
the probability that it will occur increases with the length of time contamination on this scale is left untreated .
if polluted terrain is left unattended for too long , environmental damage occurs , as detailed under disasters .
once an environmental disaster has occurred , the cycle starts over again .
the planet achieves equilibrium at the new , higher temperatures .
if pollution continues or increases once more to high levels , another bout of environmental problems might occur .
this cycle can repeat endlessly if pollution is not controlled .
minor tribes .
thatch-roofed hut icons scattered about the map of the world indicate the presence of minor tribe villages .
these populations are too isolated , too unorganized , or too migratory to develop into major civilizations .
minor tribes react to contact with a range of emotions , from delight to hostility .
there is no way to predict a village's response , but most potential responses are favorable .
there is one unique situation : air units can not encounter minor tribe villages .
instead , their overflight scares the villagers , and the hut icon vanishes as the tribe abandons their territory in terror .
playtesters and civilization fans alike call these hut icons "goody huts."
here's what might happen when you move a ground unit onto terrain that a minor tribe occupies .
• occasionally a minor tribe is sufficiently advanced , yet awed by your emissary , to immediately form a new city and become part of your civilization .
• on the other hand , your unit might have stumbled upon a village which has discovered an advance unknown to your civilization .
graciously , they share their knowledge .
• to placate your emissary unit , a village might give your civilization valuable resources -lrb- gold -rrb- as a gift .
the gift is added to your treasury .
• your emissary unit stirs up the young bloods in the village with his tales of valor and victory .
all the impressionable warriors run off to join your army , creating a new military unit "carrying your colors."
• your emissary makes a horrible faux pas , and the minor tribe turns vicious .
a random number of barbarian units comes boiling out of the terrain squares that adjoin the village .
duck -lrb- or run , if you can -rrb- !
• your emissary arrives at a spot rumored to contain a village only to find the inhabitants long gone and the dwellings empty .
nothing occurs .
• your unit catches up with a particularly peripatetic tribe , and impresses them with his or her goods and possessions .
the minor tribe is willing to join your civilization , though not necessarily interested in settling in their present location .
the villagers become a settlers -lrb- or engineer -rrb- unit carrying your shield .
movement .
there are two basic methods of moving units a square or two at a time : by keyboard commands or -lrb- if you have enabled mouse movement -rrb- by mouse clicks .
the keyboard method uses the eight edge keys of the numeric keypad .
the 5 key in the center is inactive ; think of it as your unit's position .
the keys surrounding the 5 represent the points of a compass .
for example pressing 7 sends your unit northwest , while pressing 6 sends your unit east .
the mouse method involves placing your mouse cursor near the edge of the unit in the direction you want it to travel .
when the cursor turns into an arrow pointing in the appropriate direction , click the left mouse button to make the unit move .
note that this method works only if you turn on the move units w/ mouse option in game options .
you can also use the goto order to send a unit over long distances , as we explain in detail under goto orders .
units can move up to the limit of their movement factors , with a few caveats .
the most important exception is that a unit can always move at least one square in a turn , regardless of the movement point cost of the terrain .
are we saying a unit can always move ?
not quite .
an enemy unit or city's presence can hamstring any unit with the zone of control restriction , as you'll see in a moment .
there are other , common-sense restrictions on where units can move and where they can't , which are elaborated under movement restrictions .
back to movement factors .
a unit with a movement factor greater than one must compare its movement factor with the movement point cost of the terrain square you wish it to enter .
the unit pays the movement point cost -lrb- subtracts the movement point cost from its remaining movement factor -rrb- for each new square it enters , until you choose to stop advancing , or the unit's movement factor is smaller than the movement point cost of the terrain square .
there's a small chance that a unit can enter a square , even if its movement factor is lower than the movement point cost of the terrain , which is why sometimes chariots can cross mountains squares , and sometimes they can't .
when an army is unable to complete a movement order because it doesn't have enough movement points to proceed , its movement is finished for the turn .
the map then centers on the next active unit .
roads and railroads speed the movement of ground units .
they do this by lowering the movement point cost of the terrain over which they are built .
any terrain square with a road across it costs just one-third of a movement point to cross .
any terrain square with a railroad costs no movement points to cross — zero !
cities automatically have roads in their city squares , so entering a city square always costs one-third of a movement point .
once your civilization discovers the railroad advance , city squares are automatically upgraded to railroads , so your units can slide through them for free .
the active unit .
how do you know whose turn it is ?
every turn , civilization ii activates each unit in turn by centering the map around the unit and making it blink .
you can give orders to each unit as it becomes the active unit -lrb- see the orders menu in reference : screen by screen -rrb- .
five special orders deserve fuller explanations here .
no orders .
to skip a unit for the turn , press the skip turn z key or choose the option from the orders menu .
once you've skipped a unit's turn , the troops are on liberty for the day — you can't recall them to duty again this turn .
goto orders .
to send a unit on a long trek , you have two options .
you can click-and-hold on any square on the map until your cursor turns into a crooked "go" arrow .
if the destination square isn't visible in the map window , you can use the zoom out button to enlarge the area you are viewing , click on the world window to shift your view to another area of the map , or switch to view pieces mode by pressing the v key or choosing the option from the view menu , and move the cursor with the number pad keys .
if you'd rather send a unit to a city , you can press the goto g key or choose the option from the orders menu .
a screen pops up listing all of your cities ; click on the all players button to see every destination city in the world .
once a destination is established , the unit automatically "goes to" that square , whether it takes only one turn to complete its orders , or many turns .
if the unit is attacked , or an obstruction prevents the unit from completing its journey , it becomes active once again .
ground units can not travel between continents on a goto order .
wait orders .
to skip a unit temporarily , press the wait w key or choose that option from the orders menu .
this passes you on to the next unit and sends the skipped army to the end of the line .
you'll see this unit again after all the others have had a chance to move .
paradrop orders .
paratroopers that have not moved this turn have the special ability to make paradrops when in a city or airbase .
press the paradrop p key or choose the option from the orders menu .
your cursor turns into a parachute .
you can make a paradrop in any land square within ten of the origination square , that is not occupied by enemy troops .
as you run the mouse over the map , the cursor changes from a parachute to a crossed-out parachute to indicate "illegal" destination squares .
click on a square to make the drop .
paratroopers have one movement point after they drop to attack or change position .
airlift orders .
once your civilization has discovered the radio advance , you can build airport improvements .
once you have two or more airports , you can airlift one unit per turn into or out of each airport .
activate a unit in a city , then press the airlift key l or choose the option from the orders menu .
a list of cities with airports appears , and you can select your destination .
enemy fighters and stealth fighters within range of either the target or destination city have a chance to scramble and interdict the airlift .
activating fortified and sleeping units .
fortified and sleeping units do not become the active unit .
if you want them to move or change position , you must activate them first .
click the mouse pointer on the square in which fortified or sleeping units are stationed .
this opens a box displaying all units in that square .
click again on the icons of all units you wish to activate .
fortified or sleeping units within a city must be activated from within the city display — see city display for instructions on how to do this .
sleeping units automatically activate when enemy units move into an adjacent square .
navigating the map window .
we've talked about moving your units around the map , but there are several tools which allow you to look at different map areas and move around the game world .
first , let's describe the two modes of civilization ii .
in move pieces mode , the active unit blinks , and you can use the number pad keys or cursor arrows to move it across the map .
in view pieces mode , the square-outline cursor blinks , and you can use the number pad keys to move it across the map .
you are automatically placed in move pieces mode at the beginning of each turn , and automatically switched to view pieces mode when "end of turn" is flashing .
toggle between the modes by pressing the v key -lrb- or selecting your choice on the view menu -rrb- .
you can not switch to move pieces mode unless there are units still waiting to move .
of course , you can simply click on a map square to center the map window there .
if you want to move a long distance , you can use the zoom buttons to increase the acreage shown in the window , or click on the world window .
if your cursor is over a unit , stack of units , or city square in view pieces mode , you can press the activate unit a key to activate some or all of the units in that square .
if there is more than one unit , a pop-up box allows you to choose among them .
if the active unit in move pieces mode happens to be standing in a city , the activate unit key also works to activate any fellow units in the city , without opening the city display .
movement restrictions .
most of the restrictions placed on unit movement are a matter of common sense , as we mentioned earlier .
we're spelling them all out here , in case you try to order a unit somewhere that seems possible and the game won't let you do it .
ground units .
ground units -lrb- all non-ship and non-air units -rrb- normally move only on land .
to traverse the wide -lrb- or narrow -rrb- oceans or even to get across lakes , they must board naval transport .
not all ships take passengers ; see naval units under mobile units for a list of those that do .
boarding a ship uses up all a unit's movement points for the turn and puts it to sleep .
if you attempt to move a naval unit into a land square that does not contain a port city , any passengers are offered the option to make landfall and disembark .
if a naval unit carrying ground troops makes port , all passengers automatically wake up .
naval units .
ships normally move only on the ocean , although they can also sail across inland lakes .
ships can not navigate rivers , deltas , or swamps in the game , though of course some do in real life .
instead , river navigation is represented by the reduced movement point cost for ground units following riverbeds .
city squares that touch a shoreline along one side or at one corner are the only "land" squares that ships can enter — here they make port .
making port costs one movement point .
air units .
air units can cross both land and sea squares at a cost of one movement point per square , but they must land in a friendly city , at an airbase , or on a carrier unit to refuel every turn or two .
though planes can sometimes fly above rival ground units in real life without causing an incident , they are always required to encounter enemy ground units that they overfly in civilization ii .
to avoid attacking rival units by accident , carefully guide your planes around them .
air units have the advantage in maneuverability .
neither ground nor ship units can attack air units that appear "next to them" because of the disparate vertical locations .
the one exception is the diplomat or spy unit's ability to bribe adjacent units into switching sides .
see diplomats & spies below .
zones of control .
ground units can not move directly from one square adjacent to an enemy army or city to another such square .
the squares that surround a unit are in that unit's zone of control — the same holds true for a city .
neither ground troops nor settlers units can move directly from one rival's zone of control into another square within a rival's zone of control .
the prohibited square might be adjacent to the first enemy army , to another army -lrb- even one from a different civilization -rrb- , or to any enemy city .
ground units can only move into such a controlled square if a friendly unit or city already occupies the square , or if you have formed an alliance with a rival player -lrb- which we'll explain fully in diplomacy -rrb- .
some units have special abilities which allow them to ignore zones of control .
air units have the whole sky in which to maneuver ; naval units have the open sea .
diplomats and spies use social convention and diplomatic immunity with equal aplomb , and caravans and freight units can argue neutrality and engineer special deliveries .
partisans use intimate knowledge of the local terrain to good effect .
explorers' solitary nature and singleness of purpose get them out of tight places , and engineers' training includes techniques to infiltrate and bypass enemy positions .
the movement restrictions diagram offers a graphic representation of a unit confronted by enemy zones of control .
civilization advances .
the major dynamic of change throughout the history of civilization has been the continuing advance and accumulation of knowledge .
as humankind progressed by fits and starts through the ages , civilizations rose and fell , their success or failure due to what knowledge they acquired and how they employed it .
those who first acquire new knowledge are often able to employ it to build a more powerful position , but there are many cases of civilizations that obtained some new invention first , then failed to use it to their advantage .
the pace at which a society develops and implements new knowledge depends on many factors , including its social organization , economic organization , geographic location , leadership , and competition .
the concept of progress being not only inevitable , but even a good thing is a relatively recent phenomenon .
only in the last several hundred years have we actively studied history and considered the evidence of the historical record .
for most of human history , the pace of progress was so slow as to be barely detectable but since the industrial revolution , the pace of advance and change has dramatically increased .
rapid change is now considered normal .
for much of the world , new discoveries are continually expected and are not a surprise .
the concept of civilization advances .
as we said in city management concepts , scientific research is what drives your civilization's scientific and intellectual growth .
the science -lrb- beaker icons -rrb- each city generates every turn represents a percentage of the total trade , that city brings in .
you can adjust the amount of science generated with the tax rate option in the kingdom menu .
a low science ratio generates advances slowly ; a high ratio generates them more quickly .
you want to accumulate research , in the form of beakers , to gain advances , or new technologies .
each new advance allows your civilization to build new units or city improvements ; sometimes a new advance makes possible the construction of a new wonder of the world .
each new civilization advance also opens up a path to researching further technologies .
you could look at the connections between advances as a flow chart -lrb- see the poster for an example -rrb- , as a web , or as a tree .
the important concept is that each technology is a building block that allows research into further advances .
you can even research into the realms of science fiction ; each futuristic advance you discover adds bonus points to your final score , as we'll explain in future technology , coming right up .
accumulated research isn't the only way to gain advances .
contact with a minor tribe might also net you a new civilization advance — see minor tribes for all the possible outcomes of an encounter .
finally , parley with other civilizations can result in an option to exchange technologies , and war offers the opportunity to wrest them by force from cities you subjugate .
we'll give you the full details under diplomacy .
the scientific research performed in each city you own is totaled in the science advisor's report -lrb- see the advisor menu in reference : screen by screen for more about the science advisor and his duties -rrb- .
each new advance that your civilization discovers "costs" a certain amount of science -lrb- accumulation of beakers -rrb- .
as time progresses , new advances require more funding to research .
the science advisor's report also lists the technologies you have already discovered or been given , and the current advance your scientists are researching .
climbing the technology tree .
once your civilization begins to accumulate scientific research , your science advisor asks you to choose a new civilization advance to research .
before making your choice , you can immediately get help concerning the available technologies .
press the goal button to see a list of all the advances in the game .
select the one you're most interested in pursuing , and click ok to find out which of the options you now have will further your research toward your goal .
a message informs you if none of the options is suitable .
technologies you should be able to research but that are not on the current list of possibilities eventually show up -lrb- at a later choice-point -rrb- .
once you have chosen a direction for your research , you can not change your mind .
your scientists pursue that topic until they learn the new civilization advance .
if you are unfamiliar with the advantages of a particular advance , highlight it and click on the help button to see the civilopedia entry .
advances are divided into five broad categories : military , economic , social , academic , and applied .
the icons in front of each advance show which category each advance belongs to .
they can help you decide which advance will further your general strategy if you are , for instance , following a militaristic path , rather than an economic one .
these icons also appear in the diplomatic screens , to help summarize the technology paths of your opponents .
when research is complete , your chief investigator announces the discovery .
the civilopedia screen appears detailing the impact of the advance , including any new units , city improvements , and wonders that have become available .
the production menus in each city display are immediately revised to include these new items wherever they are appropriate -lrb- for instance , inland cities can never build ships , so ship units never appear on their production menus , even if you have discovered navigation or later seafaring advances -rrb- .
as each new advance is acquired , your advisor appears again to ask for a new topic to research .
the list of choices is updated with each new discovery to reflect your growing knowledge base .
technologies you acquire through means other than research -lrb- see diplomats & spies and minor tribes for details -rrb- no longer appear on the list of choices — you've already discovered them .
if by chance you're given the civilization advance your scientists are currently researching , your science advisor immediately switches the research effort to a new topic of your choice — the accumulated beakers that represent research into the gift advance are transferred to the new topic .
special advance effects .
a number of the advances in civilization ii have effects independent of the new units and improvements you can build .
we'll summarize these effects here .
each advance's civilopedia entry reminds you of these effects .
• achieving the corporation advance allows you to focus a city's production on revenue .
the discovery of the corporation advance allows your citizens to "build" the capitalization improvement , and market a city's research to produce high-tech consumer goods that generate tax income .
• the discovery of the democracy advance allows each courthouse improvement to make one content citizen happy .
• once your civilization discovers the electronics advance , your colosseums can make four unhappy people content in each city , not just three .
• the discovery of fusion power eliminates the possibility of a meltdown in your nuclear power plants .
in addition , it gives the thrust components of your spaceship 25 percent more power .
• both navigation and seafaring reduce the chance of your trireme units being lost at sea .
• once your culture has embraced the nuclear power advance , all of your naval units gain one extra movement point .
• if you discover the philosophy advance before any other civilization has done so , you earn a "free" advance .
• once your civilization has achieved the railroad advance , all your city squares are automatically upgraded from roads to railroads .
it no longer costs any movement points to enter cities .
• once your civilization has achieved the refrigeration advance , all your city squares are automatically upgraded from irrigated land to farmland , if the terrain is suitable .
once you build the supermarket improvement , your workers can harvest 50 percent more food from these spaces .
• the discovery of theology makes your cathedrals more influential .
instead of making three unhappy people per city content , a cathedral now relieves four .
there is one disadvantageous special effect .
once you discover the advance of communism , the effect of the cathedral improvement -lrb- which discovering the monotheism advance allows you to build -rrb- is lessened .
instead of making three unhappy people per city content , a cathedral now only relieves two .
if your culture has discovered both theology and communism , the special effects cancel each other .
wonders of the world .
a wonder of the world is a dramatic , awe-inspiring accomplishment .
it is typically a great achievement of engineering , science , or the arts , representing a milestone in the history of humankind .
as your civilization progresses through the years , certain advances make building wonders of the world possible .
twenty-eight wonders are included in civilization ii , seven each representing the four great epochs of civilization : the ancient world , the renaissance -lrb- including the high middle ages -rrb- , the industrial revolution , and the modern world -lrb- present and future -rrb- .
these wonders are the extraordinary monuments of a civilization , bringing everlasting glory and other benefits to their owners .
the concept of wonders .
wonders of the world are like extraordinary city improvements , in that they are structures -lrb- or achievements -rrb- that your civilization can undertake to "build."
unlike city improvements , each wonder is unique , existing only in the city where it is constructed .
each one confers a specific , unique benefit on the civilization that owns it -lrb- you can find the specifics in the civilopedia listing for each wonder -rrb- .
if one of your cities is captured by a rival power , and you had built a wonder there , that wonder no longer benefits your civilization .
instead , its bonuses now apply to the conquering civilization .
the same holds true if your units capture a city containing a wonder from a rival player .
if a wonder is destroyed by the decimation of the city in which it stood , it can never be rebuilt .
its benefits are lost to the world forever .
further , some of the glories of the ancient and renaissance wonders dim over time .
objects and accomplishments that awed the ancients lose their luster for people of the modern age .
the achievement of later advances can negate the benefits of older wonders , regardless of whether your civilization or another discovers the canceling advance .
constructing wonders .
you can build a wonder only if you have discovered the advance that makes it possible , and if it does not already exist somewhere else in the world -lrb- if it exists in another city , it won't appear as an option on your production menu -rrb- .
however , you can start construction of a wonder even if another civilization is working on the same project — you just race to see who gets done first .
a message warns you if another civilization's production of a wonder is imminent .
if you are building a wonder in one of your cities and the same wonder is completed elsewhere before you finish , you must convert your production to something else .
any excess shields you have accumulated beyond the number required to construct your new project are lost , so be careful what you choose .
as you click on each potential project , you see a graphic representation of the shortfall or excess of shields you currently have with respect to the new project's requirements .
wonders are not destroyed when an enemy captures the city in which they exist .
however , if a city possessing a wonder is destroyed -lrb- that is , if its population is reduced to zero by siege or bombardment -rrb- , that wonder is lost forever and can not be rebuilt .
wonders of the world are often long-term projects -lrb- as befits their magnificence -rrb- .
if you want to accomplish construction of a wonder faster than the city that is building it can generate shields , you have several options .
you can divert trade goods into the wonder's coffers by moving a caravan or freight unit into the city of construction and accepting the choice help build wonder — see caravans & freight for details about caravan interactions .
you can also spend cash directly from your treasury .
click the buy button at the top of the production menu ; if you have enough cash on hand to purchase the wonder , you can choose to pay , and the wonder will be completed next turn .
in addition , you can disband troops currently in the city that is constructing the wonder .
each disbanded unit contributes shields equal to one-half its construction cost directly to the resource box , representing the reallocation of support from the unit to the construction .
wonders can be built in any city and more than one may be built in the same city .
each wonder has both specific and general benefits .
you can read about the specific benefits in the appropriate civilopedia entry .
the glory that accrues to your civilization for possessing a wonder is one of the general benefits conferred by such great works ; more importantly , this glory continues to accrue even if new advances make the wonder's specific benefit obsolete .
in addition , each wonder that your civilization possesses adds to your civilization ii score .
the presence of wonders is significant to the calculations determining the top five cities in the world .
further , the presence of wonders influences historians , such as gibbon , who periodically rate the world's civilizations .
finally , wonders also sway your people to improve your throne room -lrb- see throne room for the particulars -rrb- .
units .
units are groups of citizens , soldiers , and envoys that can move around the world of civilization ii and interact with other units and civilizations .
some non-combat units , like caravans , explorers , and settlers , have special functions which are explained separately .
unit concepts .
units are the pieces you move around on the map in civilization ii .
each civilization's units carry a different color shield .
units carrying red shields are always barbarians .
units can be divided into types according to the way they move : ground -lrb- or land -rrb- units , air units , and naval -lrb- or sea -rrb- units .
each unit has statistics for attack strength , defense strength , and movement points .
these stats are listed in a shorthand , code-like set of numbers , which we've already mentioned is called the adm — this stands for attack/defense/movement .
you can find each unit's adm numbers in the civilopedia .
in addition , each unit — even non-combat units — has statistics for hit points and firepower , which are also found in the civilopedia .
the strength bar at the top of a unit's shield indicates how many hit points that unit currently has , both by its length and by its color .
attack strength shows the likelihood of inflicting damage when attacking an opponent .
units with a high attack strength are useful for offensives in which they are attacking .
defense strength represents the ability of a unit to defend itself when attacked ; it is the likelihood that damage will be inflicted on an attacking unit .
units with high defense strength are useful for defending cities and other positions against enemy troops .
the terrain on which a unit stands can increase its defensive strength , as you'll find in terrain & movement .
movement points indicate how far a unit can travel — or how many times a unit can attack — in a turn ; they're explained in detail in terrain & movement , too .
hit points indicate how much damage a unit can withstand before it is destroyed .
units with a greater number of hit points can absorb more damage in combat .
a green strength bar indicates that a unit has more than two-thirds of its hit points remaining , a yellow strength bar means the unit has between one-third and two-thirds of its hit points , and a red strength bar show that a unit has less than one-third of its total hit points remaining .
hit points can be restored by skipping turns , especially in cities with repair facilities .
firepower indicates how much damage a unit can inflict in a round of combat .
units with a high firepower pack a powerful wallop .
a unit's status is important when you want to give it orders .
units can be on active status , which means they blink each time they become the active unit .
units on sleep status remain inactive until an enemy unit comes within one square of them .
at this point , they "wake up" and become active .
units on fortified status are also inactive -lrb- their status is indicated by the letter "f" on the unit's shield , and by the brown "entrenchment" icon which appears around the base of the unit — in fact , they are entrenched in a defensive posture .
they remain inactive even if rival units approach them .
clicking on either a sleeping or fortified unit allows you to change its status to active .
when the unit becomes the active unit , you can give it new orders .
every unit has an observation factor .
most units can only "see" units and objects on the edges of the terrain squares directly adjacent to their own .
early in the game , when most of the map is black , the limits of this observation area are obvious , as the blackness rolls back only so far with each move a unit makes .
even after you have explored a continent , barbarians and rival units can appear "out of nowhere" because they are lingering outside the limits of your units' observation .
some advanced units have greater observation factors .
they can "see" into a second square in all directions , which makes them useful for monitoring rival's movements and anticipating surprise attacks .
exceptional observation factors are noted in unit descriptions in the civilopedia .
military units .
through the years , the majority of your time is spent moving and positioning armies .
a strong military is the best defense against rivals and barbarians .
military units are also the eyes of your civilization , exploring the world as they move .
finally , they can serve you offensively by defeating the armies of your rivals and capturing their cities .
armies can be ground units -lrb- legions , cannons , and armor , for example -rrb- , naval units -lrb- triremes , ironclads , battleships , etc. -rrb- , or air units -lrb- fighters , bombers , and nuclear units -rrb- .
several non-combat units need further explanation , so they're discussed in detail a little later .
all units , whether they are combat or non-combat oriented , are described in the military units option of the civilopedia .
ground units .
the majority of civilization ii's units are ground units .
these armies move over the map terrain square by terrain square .
they spend movement points according to the type of terrain they are entering , observe movement restrictions like zones of control , and attack rival units when you move them into a square containing an enemy army .
most ground units have an observation of one square .
pillage .
armies can strip the countryside through which they roam of any improvements any settlers or engineer units have built , tearing up roads , trampling crops , and collapsing mines .
the occupying army destroys your choice of one improvement each time you press the s and p keys simultaneously , or choose pillage from the orders menu .
it takes one turn to pillage one improvement .
air units .
air units operate under some special movement rules .
these units can cross any terrain square at a cost of one movement point per square .
because they are airborne , they get no bonus for crossing squares improved by roads or railroads .
all air units except missiles have an observation range of two squares in any terrain .
most air units must end their movement in a friendly city with an airport , at an airbase , or on a carrier unit , as these are the only areas where they can safely land .
bombers and stealth bombers must land for refueling every second turn , giving them effective ranges of 16 -lrb- 8 out and 8 back -rrb- and 24 -lrb- 12 out and 12 back -rrb- , respectively .
bombers and stealth bombers can only attack once , regardless of their remaining movement points .
in addition , attacking uses all a unit's remaining movement points for the turn .
therefore , if you attack during a bomber or stealth bomber's return flight , it does not have enough movement points to return home safely , and it crashes and disappears .
fighters and stealth fighters can attack targets as many times as they have movement points .
however , be sure you save enough movement after the attack to return to a landing area , or your pilots kamikaze !
both missile units are one-shot attackers ; the icons represent missiles that are spent in the aggression .
if you have miscounted the number of squares to your destination , or another unit's movement or position prevents a missile unit from reaching a target city or unit , you can attempt to return the missile to a friendly city or airbase , or to a submarine or carrier unit .
if your missile gets stranded — that is , there is no target unit or city within reach , and no safe landing area — the missile is a dud that falls to earth harmlessly .
it disappears from the game .
if a city is the target of a cruise missile attack , the strongest military unit defends against it -lrb- the unit in that city with the largest defense factor -rrb- .
there is no collateral damage to city improvements from cruise missile attacks .
if a city is the target of a nuclear missile attack , half of the population is destroyed .
all military units in and adjacent to the target square are destroyed as well , regardless of the civilization to which they belong .
if a military unit or stack of units is the target , all units in the stack are destroyed .
in addition to the loss of units , all land terrain squares adjacent to the impact square become polluted .
helicopters are unique air units in that they don't need to return to a base for refueling , giving them an unlimited movement range similar to a ground unit .
however , every turn a helicopter starts in the field — not taking off from a friendly city , airbase or carrier — it suffers a small amount of damage .
eventually , it must return to a friendly city or airbase for repairs .
a helicopter can only make one attack per turn ; attacking uses all remaining movement points for that turn .
naval units .
naval units also adhere to some special rules .
some naval units have the capacity to carry passengers — ground units .
these include triremes , caravels , galleons , frigates , and transports .
carriers can only transport air units .
submarines can only transport missile units .
when two ships occupy the same square , the one that leaves first takes up to its carrying capacity of passenger units with it .
most naval units can conduct shore bombardments — that is , they can attack units standing on the coastal squares of continents and islands .
because of the high degree of inaccuracy , the firepower of both the ship and its target is reduced to one when a ship bombards a unit , city , or stack on shore .
submarine and transport units can not conduct shore bombardments at all .
battleships , carriers , cruisers , destroyers , and submarines have enhanced observation ranges at sea .
each can "see" enemy ships and planes from two ocean squares away .
rival submarine units are the only exception to this rule , as their ability to travel underwater camouflages them from most units' view -lrb- it likewise conceals your subs from your enemies -rrb- , unless the submarine is attacking the observing unit .
destroyers , cruisers , aegis cruisers , and helicopters can all spot submarines if they are adjacent to them .
note that submarines can not spot rival submarines !
combat .
combat occurs when a unit attempts to enter a map square occupied by a unit or city of another civilization — unless the unit is a diplomat or spy , in which case it can offer bribes to units or conduct a variety of business in cities — or unless the unit is a caravan or freight unit , in which case it can establish a trade route when it enters a city .
everybody else just fights .
battles are immediately resolved .
most battles result in the destruction of one army or the other .
when more than one unit occupies the defender's square , the unit with the highest defensive strength -lrb- as determined by comparing the second digit in the units' adm numbers , and making allowance for veteran status -rrb- defends .
if it loses , then all other armies stacked with it are destroyed as well .
however , stacked units taking advantage of fortress improvements or taking cover in city squares are destroyed one at a time .
the effect of damage .
successful attackers which have movement points remaining after combat can continue moving — and even continue attacking — normally , if they choose .
however , successful attackers often sustain damage in each battle .
as a unit is damaged , its strength bar gets shorter , and eventually changes color .
both the length of the strength bar and the color are significant .
when a unit is reduced to approximately two-thirds of its full strength , the strength bar changes from green to yellow .
when a unit's hit points are reduced to around one-third of its full strength , the bar changes from yellow to red .
in addition to losing strength , damaged units also lose mobility .
a unit's damage is factored into its movement allowance , so a unit which has sustained damage of 30 percent only has 70 percent of its movement points .
for example , if the damaged unit normally had three movement points , damage of 30 percent would reduce its movement to two -lrb- even though it would still have a green strength bar -rrb- .
there are two important exceptions to this rule : naval units are never reduced below two movement points per turn , and air units do not suffer reduced movement at all .
calculating the winner .
combat in civilization ii is essentially like a rapid-fire boxing match .
units fight one-on- one in rounds , with damage equal to the firepower of the winner being subtracted from the hit points of the loser of each round .
when one unit loses all its hit points , it is destroyed .
if the loser is defending a stack of units and they are not inside a fortress or a city , the whole stack is destroyed .
the important factors in combat are the attack and defense strengths of the combatants as well as their hit points and firepower ; the presence of veteran units on either side ; the terrain occupied by the defender ; and any defensive improvements in the square .
in addition to considering all of these factors , combat also includes an element of chance .
imagine that sometimes , a unit just gets lucky .
we don't want to drag you through lots of heavy arithmetic for each combination of factors , but the calculations for each round of combat can be boiled down to a simple comparison .
the total modified attack and defense factors are combined and the probability of either side winning is approximately the ratio of each side's factor compared to this total .
for example , if an elephant -lrb- attack factor 4 -rrb- attacks a phalanx -lrb- defense factor 2 -rrb- , the total of the factors is 6 -lrb- 4 + 2 -rrb- .
the elephant has about a 66 percent chance of winning -lrb- 4 out of 6 -rrb- and the phalanx about a 33 percent chance -lrb- 2 out of 6 -rrb- .
both the elephant and the phalanx have ten hit points and a firepower of one , so the battle goes between ten and nineteen rounds , until one or the other unit is reduced to zero hit points .
it is possible for one opponent to win every round and take no damage at all , and it is possible for the opponents to trade damage for damage until even the eventual winner is badly beaten up .
most combats fall somewhere in the middle .
adding in adjustments .
how do those adjustments for veteran status and terrain and so on work ?
they're added into each factor they affect before the total is determined .
for instance , if both units are veterans , each gets a 50 percent bonus to attack and defense , giving the elephant an attack factor of 6 -lrb- 4 + 2 -rrb- and the phalanx a defense factor of 3 -lrb- 2 + 1 -rrb- .
of course , modifying each unit's factors also changes the total : instead of 6 , it is 9 -lrb- the total of each modified factor , 6 + 3 -rrb- .
now the odds are close to 6 out of 9 for the elephant and about 3 out of 9 for the phalanx .
if both are veterans and the phalanx is behind city walls -lrb- which triples a unit's defense factor , making the veteran phalanx a 9 -rrb- , the odds are about 6 out of 15 for the elephant and close to 9 out of 15 for the phalanx .
though the adjustments change the odds of each unit winning a single round , they have no affect on the total number of rounds or on the amount of damage inflicted .
there are a number of special combat situations , which have special rules , detailed below .
air battles .
only fighters and stealth fighters can attack bomber or stealth bomber units .
in fact , bombers and stealth bombers prevent enemy units -lrb- other than fighters and stealth fighters -rrb- from even entering , much less attacking , the square they occupy .
when a fighter or stealth fighter attacks a helicopter unit , the helicopter's disadvantage is represented by reducing its firepower to one and reducing its defense factor by 50 percent .
when a fighter or stealth fighter is stationed in a city that is attacked by a bomber or stealth bomber , the defending units scramble , gaining a defense factor four times their normal value .
however , they gain no additional protection from sam missile batteries -lrb- because the sams don't want to down their own planes -rrb- .
air defense .
when an aegis cruiser is attacked by air units , it gains defense bonuses : the defense factor is tripled against plane or helicopter attacks , and it is increased five times against missile attacks .
city attacks .
a successful ground attack on a city destroys only one defending unit at a time .
however , each successful attack also reduces the population of the city by one point unless the city is protected by city walls .
population loss does not result from naval or air attack , but is caused by a nuclear strike .
city defenses .
the city walls improvement triples the defense strength of units within against all ground units except howitzers , and it protects a city's population from reduction .
the coastal fortress doubles the defense strength of all units within a city against shore bombardments by enemy ships .
the sam missile battery doubles the defense strength of all units within the city against all air units except nuclear missiles .
see nuclear attacks for the scoop on sdi defense improvements .
fortresses .
units within a fortress gain significant advantages .
a unit stationed within a fortress doubles its defensive strength , and stacked units are destroyed one at a time .
settlers or engineer units can build fortresses on any terrain square -lrb- except a city square -rrb- once your civilization has discovered the construction advance ; see settlers & engineers for the complete scoop .
nuclear attacks .
nuclear attacks occur when a nuclear unit attempts to enter a square occupied by enemy units or an enemy city .
a spy unit can make a suicide bomber attack by smuggling a nuclear unit into an enemy city , regardless of the presence of an sdi defense city improvement .
in any case , all units in the target square and adjacent squares are destroyed , regardless of their cultural allegiance -lrb- in other words , both theirs and yours -rrb- .
in addition , a bombed city loses half of its population .
the defense against most nuclear attacks is the sdi defense city improvement .
an sdi defense improvement is like an umbrella that extends three squares from a city in any direction .
the city and all units and improvements within this radius -lrb- including airports , fortresses , and other city squares -rrb- are protected from all effects of a direct nuclear missile attack , other than the suicidal bomber spy mentioned previously .
pearl harbor .
when air units or ground units attack ships in port -lrb- naval units defend a city against air units -rrb- , the attackers' firepower is doubled against the defending units and the defender's firepower is reduced to one , to represent the defenders' vulnerability .
air units also pick off city defenders one at a time , except for nuclear missiles -lrb- see nuclear attacks , above -rrb- .
shore bombardments .
other than submarines , any naval units with an attack factor greater than zero can attack enemy units on adjacent land squares -lrb- they are conducting shore bombardments -rrb- .
cities along the coastline are vulnerable to shore bombardments , too .
naval units can defend the cities they occupy against attack , though their firepower is reduced to one because of their limited maneuverability .
caravans & freight .
caravan units represent shipments of trade goods and materials .
though the icon remains a camel , as history progresses , your caravan units are stand-ins for the continuum of trade vehicles from camel caravans to wagon trains .
they can be used to establish trade routes between cities or to transfer resources for the construction of wonders of the world .
caravans become available once you have achieved the advance of trade .
once your civilization has discovered the corporation , the freight unit replaces the caravan unit on the production menu .
freight units have two movement points a turn .
they represent the modern movement of goods and materials by truck convoys and cargo containers .
trade routes .
a caravan or freight unit can establish a trade route by entering any city , even a rival's city .
your treasury gains an immediate cash payment for delivery of the first load of goods , and your research scientists gain an immediate bonus for cultural exchange of an equal amount of science -lrb- beakers -rrb- .
the home city of the caravan or freight unit gains an increase in the trade generated each turn , which represents a continuing economic relationship .
a listing in the general information window shows the cities with which trade routes have been established , and the amount of bonus trade generated every turn .
the bonus is added to the total amount of trade your city produces , so that indirectly this boosts your research , tax , and luxury production in that city .
each city can have up to three functioning trade routes , one for each commodity the city produces .
as each route is established , the commodity traded on that route is enclosed in parentheses , to indicate a successful deal .
thereafter , when a caravan is completed , loads of that commodity are no longer available .
food loads are always available .
the amount of trade generated by a trade route depends greatly on supply and demand , and partly on the size of the two cities .
bigger cities generate more trade .
trade with a city from another civilization is of greater value than trade with friendly cities .
the farther apart the two cities are , the greater the bonus for trading between them .
trade bonuses also increase when the cities are on different continents .
if you capture a rival city with whom you were previously trading , the trade route remains active .
however , the amount of trade it generates is reduced , because items which were once exotic imports have become domestic commodities .
caravans and freight can enter any city they can reach .
they are not hampered by movement restrictions like zones of control , but their adm numbers are low enough that they might find it difficult to smuggle goods into an enemy city without being destroyed .
caravan and freight units can take advantage of naval transport to trade overseas -lrb- you can load them aboard any ship that carries units -rrb- , and they can disembark into a city directly from a ship .
supply & demand .
each city in the game can supply three commodities because of their local abundance .
similarly , each demands three other commodities , which are locally in short supply .
while a caravan or freight unit can deliver goods to any city , it gains the largest profits from delivering a commodity to a community that demands it .
you can check the marketplace wisdom by clicking the supply & demand button at the bottom of the trade advisor's report .
a list of commodities appears .
choose the commodity in which you're interested , then click ok .
a second list shows all known cities that supply the item and all known cities that demand it .
the list is updated to reflect your exploration and contact with other cultures .
food caravans .
a fourth and always available option for trade goods is food .
you can transfer one food per turn to another city by sending a load of food from a city with a surplus to a city that needs help .
a needy city can be on the receiving end of more than one food route .
once a food route is established , it can not be countermanded .
it is automatically canceled , however , if the sending city runs out of food for its own people .
building wonders .
a caravan or freight unit can contribute shields equal to its construction cost to any wonder of the world you are undertaking .
simply move your caravan or freight unit into the city in which construction of a wonder is underway .
a dialog box offers you the choice of contributing to the construction .
if you decide to help build the wonder , your caravan or freight unit disappears and its worth is added to the production of the wonder , speeding its completion .
if you divert goods to help build a wonder , they are still available later to establish a trade route .
diplomats & spies .
diplomats are unique units that can act as ambassadors , envoys , secret agents , and saboteurs .
they can open contacts with other civilizations and establish embassies to gather information about your rivals .
they can steal information and otherwise disrupt your rivals .
they can bribe enemy armies .
stationing diplomat or spy units in your own cities reduces the effectiveness of enemy diplomats and spies .
when your civilization obtains the advance of writing , you can build diplomats .
be aware that enemy diplomats can use all the same techniques against your civilization as you use against theirs .
once your civilization has developed the espionage advance , the spy unit replaces the diplomat unit on the production menu .
a spy is superior to a diplomat in several ways .
her greater sophistication and more elaborate training allows her to choose a specific technology or target improvement when entering a city intent on mischief .
in addition , she can travel more rapidly , moving up to three squares a turn , regardless of the terrain .
a spy has an observation range of two squares in every direction .
when a spy successfully completes a mission , she has a chance of escaping and returning to the nearest friendly city .
the easier the mission , the greater the chance that she will escape .
for instance , stealing a random civilization advance is easier than stealing a specific one .
finally , spies have the unique ability to plant nuclear devices in enemy cities , as we'll explain in entering enemy cities .
bribing enemy units .
you might convince an enemy unit to defect and join your civilization .
only units of civilizations governed by democracy are completely immune to bribery .
in game terms , simply move a diplomat or spy into a square occupied by a single enemy unit -lrb- neither diplomats nor spies can bribe units that are stacked together -rrb- .
a dialog box appears , showing how much gold the unit demands to defect .
if the unit is immune to bribery , a dialog box will remind you of this condition .
the farther a unit is from its capital , the less gold is required .
if you accept , the gold is deducted from your treasury and the army switches sides -lrb- becomes your color -rrb- .
the diplomat or spy survives the discussion regardless of his or her success in negotiating ; however , if you do not choose to pay the bribe , the enemy unit might attack your negotiator later .
diplomats and spies can bribe naval and air units as long as these are not stacked with other units .
the nearest friendly city becomes the home city for a newly bribed unit -lrb- see unit roster for information on this point -rrb- .
counterespionage .
diplomats and spies stationed in friendly cities have a chance to thwart "steal technology" attempts by enemy diplomats and spies .
each diplomat has a 20 percent chance to do so per attempt .
spies have a 40 percent chance ; veteran spies have a 60 percent chance of catching their fellow envoys .
getting caught ends the interloper's turn .
entering enemy cities .
diplomats and spies can slip past enemy armies without pausing to observe zones of control , using superior powers of persuasion and/or diplomatic immunity as a shield .
diplomats and spies are also subject to deportation -lrb- a special form of "attack" -rrb- even from civilizations with which they are not at war .
any military unit can "attack" a diplomat or spy from a civilization with which it is at peace , provided that the envoy is nearer to a city of the military unit's culture than to one of its own cities .
the offending envoy is returned to friendly territory .
diplomats and spies can travel overseas in ships as do other ground units .
diplomats and spies are two of only four units that can enter defended enemy cities -lrb- caravans and freight are the other two -rrb- .
a menu listing the tasks a diplomat or spy can perform appears whenever you send your envoy on an urban mission .
if , after you've looked over your choices , you decide not to take any action , click the cancel button to back out of the menu .
each task is fully explained below .
international incidents .
whenever a diplomat or spy successfully steals technology , sabotages a city improvement , poisons the water supply , or incites a revolt in a city of a civilization with whom you have signed a treaty , an international incident almost inevitably occurs .
your victim is likely to treat your treachery as an act of war , although a victim with whom you are allied may sometimes choose to disregard your act .
in addition , if you are governing your civilization as a republic or democracy , there might be domestic repercussions as well .
your government may collapse into anarchy when the scandal reaches the senate floor .
do not confuse international incidents with a spy's ability to escape unharmed after a mission — the two events are completely independent .
the only times when incidents do not occur are when you are already at war with your victim and when the diplomat or spy fails in its mission .
investigate city .
your diplomat or spy unit gathers information about the rival city's production and development .
in game terms , this option shows you the enemy's city display .
you can examine what armies are defending the city and what improvements have been built there .
when you exit the city display , you return to the map window .
your diplomat has been eliminated , or your spy has been charged one-third of a movement point for her efforts .
there is no possibility that your envoy is detected .
until the end of the turn , you may click on the city again at any time to review the knowledge you have gained .
establish embassy .
your diplomat or spy unit establishes official contact with the rival civilization , setting up an office in the city to which you sent him or her .
if you sent a diplomat , he stays there to head the office , so the icon disappears ; if you sent a spy , she has been charged one-third of a movement point for her efforts .
there is no possibility of international embarrassment .
in game terms , you can access information about your rival's type of government , treasury , number of armies , the name of its capital city , treaties with other civilizations , diplomatic states , and technological advances whenever you look at your foreign minister's report -lrb- see advisors for the complete scoop -rrb- .
it is only necessary to establish an embassy once with any particular civilization .
steal advance .
your diplomat or spy attempts to steal one civilization advance from a rival civilization .
in game terms , a diplomat can only confiscate one advance per city .
a spy can make more than one attempt per city , although her chance of capture increases with every additional mission .
if you send a spy , she has the option to try the more difficult task of filching a specific advance from the list of unique technologies your rival has .
even if he succeeds , a diplomat disappears in the process -lrb- his cover is blown -rrb- .
if she evades capture , a spy returns to the closest friendly city , and is promoted to veteran status for her work .
while veteran status can not improve her adm rating of zero defense , it does increase her chances of escaping detection on later missions .
if you have already stolen a civilization advance from this particular city , or if the enemy civilization has discovered no technology worth stealing , and your envoy is undetected , a diplomat unit loses its turn but is not destroyed .
if the enemy civilization has discovered no technology worth stealing , a spy remains empty-handed .
the only way a spy can fail to steal an advance is if she has opted to confiscate a particular technology .
industrial sabotage .
carefully maneuvering in the back streets , your envoy manages to infiltrate some critical city organization or defense .
in game terms , your diplomat or spy destroys either whatever item the rival city currently has under production , or one of the rival city's existing improvements — the item targeted is a matter of random chance .
if you send a spy , she has the option to try the more difficult task of destroying a specific target from the list of existing improvements that city has .
regardless of his success , a diplomat is lost in the effort -lrb- think mad , suicidal bombers if it helps -rrb- .
if your spy is not captured , she returns to the closest friendly city , and is promoted to veteran status for her work .
while veteran status can not improve her adm rating of zero defense , it does increase her chances of escaping detection on later missions .
the only way a spy can fail to complete her sabotage is if you have opted to destroy a particular improvement .
if your envoy destroys a critical improvement , it might throw the city into unrest -lrb- temple , cathedral -rrb- , weaken its defenses -lrb- city walls , coastal fortress -rrb- , or cut its production -lrb- factory , solar plant -rrb- .
diplomats and spies never destroy wonders of the world .
incite a revolt .
your diplomat or spy contacts dissidents within a city and provides the necessary means for them to overthrow their current regime .
in game terms , for a suitable payment , the city revolts and joins your civilization .
the amount needed to finance a revolt depends on the size of the city and its proximity to the enemy civilization's capital .
if you wish to avoid an international incident , you must subvert the city by paying double the listed amount , as the dialog box warns .
enemy capitals never agree to revolt , and neither do cities in a democracy .
cities with courthouses cost twice as much to bribe .
cities under communism tend to remain expensive to bribe even when they are situated far from their capital .
also , it costs less to push a city already in civil disorder into open revolt than it does to undermine a contented city .
a diplomat is lost in a successful revolt -lrb- he stays to organize the new government -rrb- .
a spy returns to the closest friendly city if she is not captured , after appointing a new city government .
a successful spy is promoted to veteran status .
if you don't have enough cash to finance the project , your envoy doesn't even attempt to incite the natives .
he or she escapes outside the city if you refuse to pay the cost .
if the overthrow is successful , all units within one square of the revolting city that belong to that rival civilization also revolt and join your regime .
all other rival units who counted that city as home are disbanded .
all existing city improvements except temples and cathedrals remain intact .
poison the water supply .
only spies can attempt to weaken the resistance of a rival city by poisoning the water supply .
in game terms , a successful attempt reduces the target city's population by one point .
if your spy is successful and undetected , she discards her environment suit and returns to the closest friendly city for promotion to veteran status .
plant nuclear device .
only spies can attempt to plant nuclear devices in rival cities .
in game terms , this is the only way to nuke a city protected by the sdi defense improvement .
this is the most difficult mission to accomplish , and the likelihood of capture is high .
furthermore , there is the possibility that your spy will be caught red-handed , causing a major international incident .
if this happens , every civilization in the world will declare war on you , appalled by your atrocity -lrb- unless you have a fundamentalist government -rrb- .
settlers & engineers .
settlers are groups of your most resourceful and adventurous citizens .
as independent pioneers , they perform two critical functions for your civilization ; they found new cities and they serve as civil engineers , improving the terrain for your empire's benefit .
after your civilization develops the explosives advance , the engineer unit replaces the settlers unit on the production menu .
these industrial-era citizens have better training and better equipment than your basic settlers unit .
engineers can accomplish all the same tasks as settlers can , and they can perform them twice as quickly .
in addition , engineers have the unique ability to transform formerly unimprovable terrain like desert , glacier , and mountains squares .
your civilization produces settlers and engineers in the same manner as it does any other unit , with one caveat .
when one of these units is completed , the population of the city that produced it is reduced by one point -lrb- one citizen on the population roster -rrb- , representing the emigration of these pioneers .
if a city has only one population point when it completes the task of building a settlers or engineer unit , the city disappears when its population is absorbed into the new unit .
this is one of the only ways to eliminate a city that is in a poor or inconvenient location .
founding new cities & increasing existing ones .
to found a new city , move a settlers or engineer unit to the desired location and press the build b key , or choose build new city from the orders menu .
the unit disappears as the people it represents become the first population point of the new city .
the add to city order can be used to increase the size of an existing city with less than ten population points .
move a settlers or engineer unit into an existing city and press the build b key or choose add to city from the orders menu .
the unit is absorbed into the city , adding one point to its population .
making improvements .
settlers , and later engineers , can make a number of agricultural and industrial improvements to your civilization's topography .
each task takes a certain number of turns to complete , depending on the terrain being improved .
some improvements can only be undertaken after your civilization has acquired certain technologies .
engineers , being better trained and equipped , can accomplish tasks twice as fast as settlers .
engineers are also the only units that can transform terrain .
teamwork makes these units work faster .
you can combine settlers and/or engineers to accomplish tasks more rapidly .
for example , two settlers units work twice as rapidly as one , and three can accomplish a task in one- third the standard time .
one settlers unit and an engineer can also accomplish a task in one-third the standard time , since the engineer naturally works faster than the settlers .
there is no limit to the number of times your settlers or engineers can build new improvements on any given terrain square — if the changing needs of your civilization demand clearing , irrigation , reforestation , clearing , pollution clean-up -lrb- detoxification -rrb- , and reforestation in succession , the land can take it .
if an option is grayed out on the orders menu , that task can not be accomplished at this time .
perhaps undertaking another improvement will make the desired option available in the future .
for instance , a plains square surrounded by forest has no access to water and can not be irrigated .
you'll need to clear at least one of the adjacent forests -lrb- one that shares a side with the target square -rrb- and irrigate it , before irrigation becomes available to the target square .
we've extracted all the variations into a table which lists the task , the shortcut key , the required advance , if any , and the terrain types which benefit from this improvement .
full explanations of each activity appear after the table .
irrigate .
depending on the form of government employed by your civilization , irrigation can improve the agricultural production of a city's relatively level terrain .
a suitable square can be irrigated if it shares one side with a source of water -lrb- ocean square or terrain with a river running through it -rrb- or another irrigated square -lrb- diagonal doesn't count -rrb- .
although your city square might be irrigated when the city is founded , it does not count as a source of water for further irrigation .
sometimes you might find it necessary to irrigate squares to which your city has no access , in order to extend irrigation into squares the city uses .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the build irrigation option on the orders menu or press the i key .
clear .
clearing terrain improves the movement point cost of dense terrain -lrb- although it eliminates the defensive bonus -rrb- , and provides land suitable to further improvement through irrigation or reforestation .
sometimes a terrain square might need to be cleared to allow for irrigation access , and later reforested to restore valuable resources .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the change to grassland -lrb- sometimes change to plains -rrb- option on the orders menu or press the i key .
build farm .
planting market gardens and other high-yield farmland is the post-industrial farmer's task .
once your civilization has discovered the refrigeration advance , settlers or engineer units can intensify the food output of irrigated land by another 50 percent in cities that build the supermarket improvement .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the improve farmland option on the orders menu or press the i key .
build fortress .
building fortresses can be essential for defense of terrain that is not a city site .
fortresses provide a defensive bonus to rural or frontier units in the same way the city walls improvement benefits urban defensive units -lrb- see combat for the full details -rrb- .
in addition , representative governments can station troops in fortresses that are within three squares of a friendly city without incurring a field service penalty -lrb- see happiness & civil disorder for complete details -rrb- .
once your tribe has discovered the construction advance , this option becomes available in the orders menu .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the build fortress option or press the f key .
mine .
mining terrain allows full utilization of the natural resources present .
it is especially useful in special terrain like coal and gold .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the build mine option on the orders menu or press the m key .
reforest .
reforestation improves the shield production of most terrain -lrb- though it increases the movement point cost of open terrain if there is no road or railroad through the square -rrb- .
reforesting plains and grassland squares also improves their defensive bonus .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the change to forest option on the orders menu or press the m key .
clean up pollution .
detoxifying squares by cleaning up the pollution there restores the full -lrb- pre-pollution -rrb- production capacity to the affected squares .
a long-term benefit of clean-up is the reduced chance of global warming , which might otherwise occur -lrb- see terrain & movement for details -rrb- .
both industrial pollution and nuclear contamination can be eliminated by clean-up efforts .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the clean up pollution option on the orders menu or press the p key .
build road .
building roads across terrain reduces the movement point cost of that square by one-third , provided that the moving unit enters from an adjacent road square .
depending on the form of government under which you civilization operates , it can also improve the trade production of the square .
roads are the foundations for railroads .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the build road option on the orders menu or press the r key .
build railroad .
laying track across terrain eliminates the movement point cost of that square providing the moving unit enters from an adjacent railroad square .
railroads also increase shield production by 50 percent , rounded down .
you can only build railroads where you have already built roads .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the build railroad option on the orders menu or press the r key .
transform .
modern equipment and engineering techniques allow workers to transform even the most inhospitable land into a productive terrain .
once your civilization has discovered the explosives advance , this option becomes available to your engineer units .
when your engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the transform option on the orders menu or press the o key .
build airbase .
building rural airbases allows your air units more flexibility in their flight plans and enables them to patrol a greater area .
once your civilization has discovered the radio advance , this option becomes available on the order menu .
when your settlers or engineer unit is positioned in the appropriate terrain square , choose the build airbase option or press the e key .
explorers .
explorers are non-combat units that can treat all terrain as roads .
their bravery and resourcefulness makes them ideal for opening up new continents and discovering the far reaches of a landmass quickly .
explorers can ignore enemy units' zones of control ; however , for diplomatic purposes -lrb- peace treaties and alliances -rrb- your rivals consider explorers as dangerous as they do combat units .
barbarians .
barbarians are small tribes of raiders that are not part of any opposing civilization .
they always carry red shields .
you can set the likelihood and frequency of barbarian attacks in the initial game choices you make .
you might encounter them periodically as your civilization begins to expand and grow .
they sometimes invade from the sea ; other times they arise suddenly in unsettled parts of any continent .
barbarians might attempt to capture or destroy your cities , and pillage your fields and mines .
most barbarian tribes are accompanied by a leader .
because barbarians can appear along any coast or in any unsettled area , it is important to defend your cities with at least one military unit .
barbarians -lrb- and rival armies -rrb- can walk right into an undefended city , capturing it with only minor bloodshed -lrb- the captured city loses one population point , just as any city taken by force does — see capturing cities under cities for the gory details -rrb- .
even if barbarians capture a city or several cities , they do not become a rival civilization — that is , they do not join the space race , or negotiate treaties , or earn rank in historians' reckonings .
sea raiders can be fought on land or engaged at sea in their ships .
land barbarians arise in areas that are outside the radius of a city .
as time passes , they appear at even farther distances from civilization .
thus , expanding your network of cities over a continent eventually removes the threat of land barbarians , because the entire area has become more or less civilized by your urban presence .
ransoming barbarian leaders .
when you attack and destroy stacked barbarian units , the leader units fall with their troops and are also destroyed .
however , if a barbarian leader stands alone in a square , and your army wins an attack against him , he is captured .
his compatriots immediately give you gold to ransom him back — the amount they pay is based on the barbarian level you chose in game setup .
barbarian leaders who have lost their armies attempt to escape .
if not captured in a few turns , they disappear .
diplomacy .
other cultures share your world in civilization ii .
if your attitude is expansionist and your home continent is large , you might seek out — and find — your rivals early in the game .
if you concentrate on perfecting your own cities or find yourself limited by a small continent , it might be centuries before you encounter other players .
whether you opt for peaceful communications or aggressive action depends on your style .
concepts of diplomacy .
eventually , no matter how isolated your location or how isolationist your policies , you will have contact with rival civilizations .
choosing to meet with a rival allows you to explore the intricacies of negotiation .
every ai opponent has an attitude that he or she presents to negotiators .
your rivals' attitudes can range from friendly to inimical .
you can tell what attitude a leader has by watching the body language of the emissary after he or she stops speaking and by observing the titles of the dialog boxes during negotiations .
a ruler's personality affects his or her attitude .
your rivals' attitudes can change over time , depending on your rank in the game , the current balance of power , the gifts you offer them , and your reputation for keeping your word in negotiations : every time you go back on your word , international observers notice and remember .
diplomatic negotiations can result in five different states : alliance , peace , cease-fire , neutrality or war .
a rival might demand money or civilization advances -lrb- the reverse is also true — you can demand money or civilization advances from rival rulers -rrb- .
in addition , negotiations can include requests to share maps and instructions to withdraw trespassing troops .
a player might even ask you to declare war on a third party .
all negotiations progress through a series of screens , each with a variety of pre-set options .
establishing embassies in your rivals' cities allows you to increase your negotiating power .
by checking your foreign minister's reports , you can see whether , for example , the bellicose indians have the city base to back up their threats , or whether they are just bluffing .
you'll have a better idea of when to back down and when to press for concessions .
conducting diplomacy with computer opponents .
diplomacy is conducted face to face with one rival emissary at a time .
an opponent can contact you any time after units from each of your civilizations have met , and the reverse is also true .
you can contact an opponent any time after your units have been adjacent to his or hers .
just select the send emissary option from the foreign minister's report in the advisors menu .
in game terms , once you choose the send emissary option , a dialog box opens , offering you several responses from which to select your intent .
the form of government under which your civilization currently operates can influence the choices you have ; see governments for the details. establishing embassies with other civilizations can be a very useful preparation for negotiations .
your foreign minister collects information from all of your embassies .
from him you can learn important facts about your opponents , including the personalities of their leaders , their diplomatic states with respect to all civilizations with whom they have contact , the number and names of their cities , the extent of their technological advances , their current research project , and the amount in their treasury .
this information is not available for civilizations with which you have not established an embassy .
mood and personality .
the tone and result of any negotiations are greatly influenced by the mood of your rival .
the opposing leader might be antagonistic , obsequious , or somewhere in between .
this mood depends on the leader's personality and how your two civilizations compare to each other and to the rest of the world .
you might pick up cues about a rival's mood from the body language of the emissary .
a rival leader's personality might be aggressive , rational or neutral .
aggressive leaders are more likely to lean toward war or demand high payments for peace .
rational leaders are more likely to offer peace and might only be bluffing when asking for payment .
if you have broken previous peace agreements with any civilization , your perfidy is remembered and influences all rivals' degree of antagonism .
if you are the largest , most powerful , and richest civilization in the world , all rivals are likely to be very demanding or antagonistic .
however , if a particular opponent is puny in comparison to your might , his or her natural tendency to belligerence might be overridden .
a civilization threatened with extinction is more interested in survival .
leaders with whom you are allied tend to become jealous as your civilization grows larger and more powerful ; they expect to be appeased with gifts of cash or knowledge .
on the other hand , allies who leap ahead of you may be generous when asked to share their good fortune .
reputation .
your reputation is based not on how peaceful or how warlike you are toward your neighbors , but on how often you keep your word .
breaking alliances or treaties can blacken your reputation in the international community .
savagely sacking the city of a treaty partner with legions , or breaking a cease-fire to bombard your opponent's city by stealth bomber are acts likely to be deplored throughout the known world .
the actions of your diplomats and spies can also damage your standing .
your computer opponents learn from your actions and adjust theirs to fit their expectations .
if you habitually break treaties , other leaders will have no qualms about doing the same to you .
it is important to note that the most severe censure is reserved for the ringleaders in group actions .
if you break your word because you were "incited" by another player , the diplomatic penalty is drastically reduced .
for example , if you have signed a treaty with the romans , and the greek emissary asks you to declare war on your erstwhile friends , it is a chance for you to break your treaty with the romans at a much- lessened penalty than if you had been the principle figure of treachery .
over long periods of time , if you mend your ways by keeping your word to other rulers , the black marks on your reputation can be partially erased and your honor somewhat redeemed .
if you build the eiffel tower wonder , the process of character redemption is speeded by a "lump sum" 25 percent shift in your favor , followed by a more rapid recovery over time .
only through the effect of the eiffel tower can a player who has broken his word regain a spotless reputation .
finally , your reputation matters on the domestic front , too .
when you choose to govern your civilization as a republic or democracy , your senate pays careful attention to your conduct in foreign affairs .
they can , for instance , force you to sign a cease-fire or peace agreement .
they are also vigilant in trying to force you to keep your agreements .
if they catch you circumventing their oversight by intentionally provoking an enemy -lrb- by refusing to leave enemy territory during a peace treaty , for instance , or if a diplomat or spy causes an international incident -rrb- , your government is likely to collapse into anarchy because of the scandal .
the five diplomatic states .
in civilization , all negotiations ended with an offer of peace or a declaration of war .
in civilization ii , however , there are finer gradations of posture , or diplomatic state , than just these two options .
the relationship between two cultures can be expressed as one of five different states : alliance , peace , cease-fire , neutrality , or war .
each has repercussions in the movement and position of armies and other units , as well as on the international reputation of the participants .
a short description of each state follows .
alliance .
in an alliance , you and your ally agree to full -lrb- or almost full -rrb- cooperation against your common enemies .
this shared purpose and trust manifests in a relaxation of restrictions .
you can freely enter each others' territories , ignoring zones of control , although you can not stack your units with those of your ally or actually enter each others' city spaces .
if you have convinced a weaker power to ally with you , that ruler will expect occasional awards for his or her faithful service .
your ally also expects your military assistance if he or she is attacked .
because an alliance involves a great deal of trust and cooperation , it is more difficult to cancel than other types of agreement .
you can not simply back-stab an ally by attacking him or her , but must first cancel your agreement during diplomatic negotiations .
all units nearer to one of your former ally's cities than to one of your own are returned from the field to the closest friendly city .
the reverse is also true : your former ally's armies are returned to his or her territory at the same time .
breaking an alliance , for any reason , is remembered as a major transgression by all of the computer-controlled players .
if you unilaterally cancel an alliance , your reputation suffers a "black mark" that is only very slowly erased by time .
to cancel an alliance without receiving a black mark , you must maneuver your ally into terminating the agreement for you .
peace .
a peace treaty is in theory a permanent arrangement , in which you and your rival agree not to attack each other or even enter the other's territory with military units .
in civilization ii a ruler's territory encompasses any space within the radii of his or her cities .
units that violate this agreement may be asked to leave — and their failure to do so immediately can be considered a treaty violation , even if circumstances -lrb- like opposing units' zones of control -rrb- render the trespassing unit temporarily immobile .
since it is a degree less cooperative than an alliance , there is no barrier that prevents you from breaking a peace treaty at any time — other than your concern for your reputation .
breaking a peace treaty is a serious matter , and your ruthlessness is long remembered by all other cultures , not merely the one you double-crossed .
if you wish to avoid the black mark on your reputation , you can try taunting the other leader into declaring war on you .
if he or she falls for the maneuver , you reputation remains spotless , though your military preparedness might suffer as your armies absorb his or her first strike .
peace treaties are most useful when you want a long period of quiet on a particular border , since their recognition of territorial borders keeps enemy units from harassing you and fortifying near your cities .
by the same token , they impede you from entrenching your units in your treaty-partner's territory .
cease-fire .
a cease-fire is an agreement with a former enemy to end a war .
your enemy might agree to a cease-fire because he or she wants to make peace , is tired of fighting , or simply wants to get some breathing space before attacking you again .
once a cease-fire is signed , your former enemy ceases attacking your units and cities for approximately 16 turns .
although a cease-fire enjoins you from attacking your former enemy , there are no territorial restrictions on where you may move your units — you can remain in your fortified positions , even adjacent to enemy cities .
of course , maintaining military units near enemy cities is considered a sign of bad faith and will lead to friction in the future .
unlike a peace treaty , a cease-fire is only a temporary agreement whose effects dwindle with time .
once the cease-fire expires , your civilizations remain in a state of neutrality -lrb- described below -rrb- until some other negotiation or aggression takes place .
a cease-fire is automatically extended for an additional 16 turns or so whenever tribute is paid by either side .
a message informs you when a cease-fire you have signed expires .
violating a cease- fire is an act of treachery that is remembered internationally , and that blackens your reputation .
neutrality .
this state represents not so much an agreement as a wary agreement to disagree — you are not openly at war with an enemy , but you have no formal connection , either .
the lack of binding paperwork means that you can freely start a war at any time simply by attacking an enemy unit or city .
on the other hand , you might also send an emissary to start negotiating a peace treaty or even an alliance with a neutral rival .
territory is considered important while cultures maintain a neutral stance , and refusing to remove a unit that has entered the opponent's territory might be enough provocation for a declaration of war .
the expulsion of your diplomat or spy from an opponent's territory is not in itself a contravention of neutrality .
war .
this diplomatic state represents the likelihood of open hostilities at any point in which your units contact your opponent's units .
however , there are times when you might enter or remain in a state of war without the exchange of gunfire , as when continents separate your main forces from the enemy's .
wars can start for innumerable reasons , ranging from self defense to greed and conquest .
war might be openly declared after a breakdown in negotiations or in return for offenses rendered by ill-placed troops , or it can start with a sudden sneak attack .
civilizations at war with yours might drag their neighbors into the conflict , too , by activating alliances -lrb- paying their allies to assist them in the attack -rrb- .
once you are at war with another civilization , that ruler considers you a hated enemy unless and until you sign a cease-fire or other , more permanent , agreement .
you must make up separately with each opponent -lrb- even those allied with a civilization with whom you have already negotiated -rrb- .
if , for instance , the vikings and the sioux were allies in a war against you , you must negotiate one agreement to end hostilities with the vikings and a separate one to placate the sioux .
negotiations .
to begin negotiations with another ruler , simply pull down the foreign minister's report from the advisor menu , and click the send emissary button .
the options available to you depend on your current diplomatic state and the attitude of your rival .
if you send too many emissaries , a leader can get annoyed and refuse to speak to you .
wait a few turns for his or her impatience to wear off , then try again .
if you are at war with a rival , he or she might make a demand that you must satisfy if you wish to progress in your negotiations or might even refuse to meet with you .
if you are in a state of neutrality or better and have not exhausted your welcome , you progress to the diplomacy menu .
again , the options available to you depend on your current diplomatic state .
we've prepared several tables to clarify your choices .
the table below displays the gist of your emissary's polished phrases , the states in which he or she is allowed to offer such remarks , and the opponent's probable response .
most results are self explanatory ; the two which direct you to other menus are expanded on below .
"have a proposal to make ... "
once you have your rival's ear , you can make a variety of suggestions .
common sense tells you that the better an opponent likes you , the more likely he or she is to agree to your proposal .
opponents also take your relative standing in the game into account .
they are more likely to be magnanimous if you are far behind than if you are the pre-eminent power in the world .
the following table gives the gist of your emissary's remarks and the rival's likely response .
exchanging knowledge : civilizations that are not extremely antagonistic might accept an offer to trade civilization advances .
they negotiate by requesting a particular advance from you .
your options include accepting the deal as offered , vetoing the exchange , or offering an alternative advance instead of the one they requested .
they , in turn , can accept or decline your revised offer .
sometimes an opponent thinks less of you for offering lesser alternatives .
you may continue trading as many technologies as you possess , provided the other party is interested .
occasionally , you might be offered an advance as a gift or for a monetary fee .
declaring war : civilizations who see an advantage in changing the balance of power might be persuaded to declare war on a mutual enemy .
they usually request a cash payment for their trouble , but might demand two advances in lieu of gold .
exchanging maps : civilizations might agree to exchange knowledge of the world in the form of accurate maps of territory they have explored .
if they accept , the darkness is rolled back in your map window to represent their information .
"have a gift to offer ... "
sometimes rivals appreciate a tangible result more than mere flowery words .
if you'd like to improve an opponent's attitude toward you , you have the option of offering a gift .
several categories of persuasion are available : knowledge , money , and troops .
offer knowledge : you can agree to offer knowledge to cement a better relationship .
your rival suggests an advance they are interested in .
you can agree to that choice , change your mind about the exchange , or make a counter-offer .
your rival's opinion of you improves with each gift you make .
offer money : you can attempt to offer a gift of cash to placate your rival .
a dialog box lists your three levels of generosity .
if you change your mind , the never mind option is always available .
your rival's opinion of you always climbs if you give him or her gold .
offer military unit : you can attempt to offer one of your existing military units to bolster a friend's army and encourage his or her good opinion .
if the leader feels your technology is superior , a list of your cities appears .
choose one to see the roster of units stationed there .
click on a unit to send .
that unit becomes part of the other civilization's army , and no longer draws support from your city .
winning the game .
as we explained in the introduction , there are two ways to win civilization ii .
you can either beat the other civilizations into space by being the first to successfully colonize a distant system , or conquer all the other civilizations in the game .
the space race .
the environmental pressures of growing populations in the modern world are forcing humans to look into space for resources and room to live .
the question is not whether humans will travel to the stars , but when .
the final act of stewardship you can perform for your civilization is to ensure that they lead this exodus .
the history of your civilization ends when either you or one of your rivals reaches a nearby star system with colonists .
if your spaceship is the first to arrive , you receive a bonus to your civilization score in recognition of this final accomplishment .
regardless of how many colonists your spaceship is carrying or how fast it is , if a rival makes planetfall first , you receive no bonus .
no civilization can undertake spaceship component construction until one civilization has built the apollo program wonder .
thereafter , the race is on and any civilization that has acquired the necessary advances can begin building the parts of a spaceship .
spaceships are in many ways a one-shot deal .
each civilization , including yours , can build only one spaceship at a time .
restrictions prevent you from building a second , back- up ship once you launch the first .
once launched , ships can not be recalled or turned around .
you can construct a second spaceship only if your current ship explodes in space or if your capital city is captured while your spaceship is under construction -lrb- the conquerors burn it on the launch pad -rrb- .
spaceships .
the purpose of your spaceship is to carry as many colonists as possible to another star system .
at a minimum , it must provide living space for colonists , life support , energy sources , propulsion power , and fuel for the engines .
spending more time constructing additional components can result in a faster voyage and a higher colonist survival rate .
as each new component is completed , the spaceship display appears , showing where the component is positioned and updating the statistics and specifications .
all spaceships have the same characteristics : population , food , energy , mass , fuel , flight time , and probability of success .
we'll explain each in turn .
population .
this figure represents the number of pioneers the spaceship is outfitted to carry .
the more citizens it carries to the new planet , the higher your bonus .
support .
this figure shows what percentage of accommodations on the ship is currently serviced by life support : air , nutrient , and waste systems .
pioneers not provided with life support can not survive the voyage .
energy .
this figure indicates what percentage of the energy required by habitation and life support modules is currently being provided .
if sufficient energy is not available to power life support and habitation , the probability of success will be very low .
mass .
all of the components , modules , and structures add to the mass of your spaceship .
the greater the mass , the more power is required from propulsion parts to move it .
fuel .
this figure indicates what percentage of the fuel your propulsion units require is currently aboard .
if insufficient fuel is provided , the propulsion components aboard can not work to their maximum power and the ship can not attain its best possible speed .
flight time .
this calculation indicates the number of years required for your spaceship to reach the nearest star , based on the ship's current mass and engine power .
adding more engines and fuel reduces flight time .
probability of success .
this figure incorporates all the other data -lrb- including the amount of food and energy available and the estimated flight time -rrb- in an estimate of the approximate percentage of colonists who are expected to survive the voyage .
the faster the flight , the higher the expected survival rate .
space ship launch .
to send your spaceship on its voyage , click on the launch button .
you can not retrieve a spaceship once it has been launched .
construction .
your spaceship is such a large undertaking that it can not be built whole cloth the way improvements are built — it is , instead , constructed of parts .
there are three types of spaceship parts : components , modules , and structures , each of which we describe in detail below .
you must achieve a new civilization advance to make each type of part available for construction .
however , the delivery of spaceship parts to your capital city is handled automatically as each part is completed .
though you can construct parts in any order , and most likely will have multiple parts under production simultaneously , all modules and components must eventually be connected to structural parts if you want them to function .
unconnected modules or components are emphasized to signal that they are not working .
once sufficient structural parts have been added to provide supply and support lines , the problem disappears .
components .
to build spaceship components you must have achieved the technological advance of plastics .
you can then build components at a cost of 160 shields each .
there are two kinds of components , propulsion and fuel .
as each component is completed , you choose which type has been built .
propulsion components : these parts are the engines that provide the power for space flight .
more engines mean the ship travels faster , reaches its destination sooner , and has a higher probability of a successful mission .
fuel components : these parts provide fuel for the propulsion units .
in order for the propulsion units to perform at maximum levels , you must provide one fuel component for each propulsion component .
modules .
spaceship modules require the advance of superconductor and cost 320 shields each to build .
they exist in three types : habitation , life support , and solar panels .
as each module is completed , you choose which type it is and add it to your ship .
habitation module : each habitation module provides living space , community services , and recreational facilities for 10 , 000 colonists .
life support module : each life support module provides the food and other requirements for the 10 , 000 colonists carried in one habitation module .
colonists carried in a habitation module that doesn't receive life support have a very low probability of surviving .
solar panel module : each solar panel module provides enough energy to power two of the other types of module .
modules that don't receive power can not function properly .
structural support .
structural units require the advance of space flight and cost 80 shields each to build .
you must build sufficient structural units to connect the components and modules together .
parts that are not connected do not work and provide no benefit to the ship .
conquering the world .
when striving to win this way , aggressiveness helps .
your object is to take over any and all rival civilizations .
note that if you vanquish other civilizations early enough in the game , some new tribe might develop a settlers unit and found a civilization using the color originally assigned to the vanquished culture .
in this way , some civilizations "re-start."
eventually , if you're lucky , you might be able to subjugate the entire world .
if at any time you control the only settled civilization , you win , and the end game sequence proclaims you the ruler of the world .
