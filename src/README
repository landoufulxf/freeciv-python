==== README for SRC ====

This is the main readme for the files in the source of the project. Most of 
this readme is focused around the monte-carlo methods. Once the monte carlo is 
reaplced with our own version this too will go out of here.

This has four folders:

- /server :       It has all the files for building the server
- /model :        The files for running the monte carlo model
- /libraries :    Various libraries used in the model
-/civ_interface : The modified client with interface

=== WHAT WE WANT TO DO ===

We would ideally like to obtain different maps in the game in form of matrices 
that can be directly ported to numpy.


== UPDATE ==
[DD/MM/YYYY]

04.12.2018: At this moment the files are same for the monte-carlo version.
