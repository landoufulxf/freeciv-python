===== OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION =====

Congratulations, this is your first step into the world of freeciv and modify it 
as you see fit. This is the official documentation and is the first one anyone 
should read, thus the name doc.0.

==== Structure of Package ====

The overall structure of the package is as follows:

|-freeciv - world (world files for the game)
|       | - connectivity (socket connection modules)

=== World ===

Each world is what the AI will see and is the client side interface to the game. 
It has all the functionality available to it as any human player would have. 


--* Final words *--

As more and more functionality is added and completed further docs will be built 
for those specific requirements. 

Happy Hacking!
