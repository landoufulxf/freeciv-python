# Logs

This is the list of milestones, occasionally I will also write alot about the project in another detailed markdown file:

`30.01.2019`: Becomes the complete package for the first time, though barely any functionality is working. More details [here](./30thJan2019.md)

`18.01.2019`: Make new repo [freeciv-related](https://github.com/yashbonde/freeciv-related) to shift the side work done on freeciv.

`10.01.2019`: Add final structure and corresponding folders.

`09.12.2018`: Finalise structure as client socket conection started adding template files in `/freeciv` folder. The structure is inspired by [freeciv-bot](https://github.com/chris1869/freeciv-bot) and builds on top of it. Remove MonteCarlo agent, complete refractoring.

`19.11.2018`: Add template for freeciv-python environment, find templates and further ideas in `/python_core` folder

`08.11.2018`: Repo created with initial commit containing [Monte Carlo Agent](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/civ/)
